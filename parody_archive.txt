**MITSURU:** (leaning in, her voice low and dangerous) "I heard that."  

**JUNPEI:** (sweating profusely, trying to backpedal) "N-no, no! I mean, uh, I was just saying... Hu Tao is *overrated*! Yeah, totally overrated! I don’t even need her! I’ll delete the game right now!"  

**MITSURU:** (raising an eyebrow, her Persona still looming behind her) "Oh? So you’re admitting it was a waste of *my* money?"  

**JUNPEI:** (nervously laughing) "Waste? No, no, no! It was an... *investment*! In, uh, team morale! Yeah, that’s it! Team morale! You know how stressed we all get fighting Shadows and stuff. Genshin is, like, therapeutic!"  

**MITSURU:** (deadpan) "Therapeutic. For *you*. While I’m out here funding your ‘therapy’ with my inheritance."  

**JUNPEI:** (grinning sheepishly) "Hey, come on, Mitsuru-senpai! You’re rich! What’s a little $500 between friends? Besides, I’ll totally pay you back! I’ll... uh... do your laundry for a month! No, two months!"  

**MITSURU:** (sighing, pinching the bridge of her nose) "Junpei, I don’t need you doing my laundry. I need you to stop treating my credit card like it’s your personal gacha fund."  

**JUNPEI:** (muttering) "But it’s so convenient..."  

**MITSURU:** (snapping her fingers, causing a small icicle to form on the tip of Junpei’s nose) "What was that?"  

**JUNPEI:** (flinching) "Nothing! I said nothing! Look, I’ll stop! I promise! No more gacha! No more Hu Tao! No more... uh... anything!"  

**MITSURU:** (narrowing her eyes) "Good. Because if I see one more charge on my statement, I’m not just freezing your phone. I’m freezing *you*."  

**JUNPEI:** (gulping) "Understood. Crystal clear. No more gacha. Got it."  

*(Mitsuru turns to leave, her Persona dissipating into the air. Junpei waits until she’s out of sight before pulling out a second phone from under the couch cushion.)*  

**JUNPEI:** (whispering to himself) "Thank goodness I had a backup... Now, where was I? Oh yeah, *one more pull*..."  

*(Suddenly, the room temperature drops. Junpei looks up to see Mitsuru standing in the doorway, her eyes glowing brighter than ever.)*  

**MITSURU:** (smiling sweetly, but with an edge of menace) "Did I stutter?"  

**JUNPEI:** (screaming, dropping the phone) "IT’S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE!"  

*(The screen fades to black as the sound of ice cracking fills the air.)*
