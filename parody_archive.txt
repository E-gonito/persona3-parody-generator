**MITSURU:** (leaning in, her voice low and dangerous) "I heard that."  

**JUNPEI:** (sweating profusely, trying to backpedal) "N-no, no! I mean, uh, I was just saying... Hu Tao is *overrated*! Yeah, totally overrated! I don�t even need her! I�ll delete the game right now!"  

**MITSURU:** (raising an eyebrow, her Persona still looming behind her) "Oh? So you�re admitting it was a waste of *my* money?"  

**JUNPEI:** (nervously laughing) "Waste? No, no, no! It was an... *investment*! In, uh, team morale! Yeah, that�s it! Team morale! You know how stressed we all get fighting Shadows and stuff. Genshin is, like, therapeutic!"  

**MITSURU:** (deadpan) "Therapeutic. For *you*. While I�m out here funding your �therapy� with my inheritance."  

**JUNPEI:** (grinning sheepishly) "Hey, come on, Mitsuru-senpai! You�re rich! What�s a little $500 between friends? Besides, I�ll totally pay you back! I�ll... uh... do your laundry for a month! No, two months!"  

**MITSURU:** (sighing, pinching the bridge of her nose) "Junpei, I don�t need you doing my laundry. I need you to stop treating my credit card like it�s your personal gacha fund."  

**JUNPEI:** (muttering) "But it�s so convenient..."  

**MITSURU:** (snapping her fingers, causing a small icicle to form on the tip of Junpei�s nose) "What was that?"  

**JUNPEI:** (flinching) "Nothing! I said nothing! Look, I�ll stop! I promise! No more gacha! No more Hu Tao! No more... uh... anything!"  

**MITSURU:** (narrowing her eyes) "Good. Because if I see one more charge on my statement, I�m not just freezing your phone. I�m freezing *you*."  

**JUNPEI:** (gulping) "Understood. Crystal clear. No more gacha. Got it."  

*(Mitsuru turns to leave, her Persona dissipating into the air. Junpei waits until she�s out of sight before pulling out a second phone from under the couch cushion.)*  

**JUNPEI:** (whispering to himself) "Thank goodness I had a backup... Now, where was I? Oh yeah, *one more pull*..."  

*(Suddenly, the room temperature drops. Junpei looks up to see Mitsuru standing in the doorway, her eyes glowing brighter than ever.)*  

**MITSURU:** (smiling sweetly, but with an edge of menace) "Did I stutter?"  

**JUNPEI:** (screaming, dropping the phone) "IT�S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE!"  

*(The screen fades to black as the sound of ice cracking fills the air.)*  

**TO BE CONTINUED...?

==================================================
**SCENE: AKIHIKO GOES TO THE GYM AND ENCOUNTERS AN ANNOYING TIKTOK GIRL**  

[AKIHIKO]: *walks into the gym, protein shake in hand, ready to punch some demons and lift some weights*  
[AKIHIKO]: (to himself) "Alright, time to get swole. Shadows don�t stand a chance against these gains."  

*Suddenly, a loud, high-pitched voice echoes through the gym.*  

[TIKTOK GIRL]: *holding a phone on a selfie stick* "OMG, gym vibes! Who�s ready for a *hot girl summer*?!" *starts doing exaggerated lunges in front of the mirror*  
[AKIHIKO]: *stares, visibly confused* "Uh� is this a new Shadow? It�s� loud."  

[TIKTOK GIRL]: *notices Akihiko* "OMG, you�re so ripped! Can you spot me while I do this TikTok trend? It�s called the *Coffin Dance Challenge*!" *starts lying on the bench press, pretending to be in a coffin*  
[AKIHIKO]: *sweating nervously* "I� don�t think that�s how bench presses work. Also, why are you holding a cup of tea?"  

[TIKTOK GIRL]: *sips tea dramatically* "It�s *coffin tea*, duh! It�s aesthetic! Now, can you pretend to be a mourner and cry while I do this?"  
[AKIHIKO]: *visibly distressed* "I don�t think my Social Link with you is high enough for this�"  

*Suddenly, the gym lights flicker, and a Shadow emerges from the mirror.*  

[SHADOW]: *in a monotone voice* "I am the Shadow of Cringe� the embodiment of your deepest regrets� like that time you posted a thirst trap and only got three likes."  
[TIKTOK GIRL]: *gasps* "OMG, that�s so relatable! Can I film this for my *Shadow Hunters* series? It�s gonna go viral!"  

[AKIHIKO]: *pulls out his Evoker* "Alright, time to summon Caesar and end this nightmare."  
[CAESAR]: *appears, flexing dramatically* "You called, my king?"  
[AKIHIKO]: "Yeah, take this Shadow down before I lose my will to live."  

*Caesar charges at the Shadow, but the TikTok Girl jumps in front of the camera.*  

[TIKTOK GIRL]: "Wait, wait, wait! Let me get a selfie with the Persona first! Hashtag *Sleep Paralysis Gang*!"  
[AKIHIKO]: *facepalms* "This is worse than fighting Nyx�"  

*The Shadow, annoyed by the TikTok Girl�s antics, suddenly self-destructs out of sheer embarrassment.*  

[SHADOW]: *exploding* "I can�t� take it anymore� the cringe� it�s too strong�"  
[TIKTOK GIRL]: *filming the explosion* "OMG, that was so cinematic! This is gonna get me, like, a million followers!"  

[AKIHIKO]: *collapses on a bench, exhausted* "I need a protein shake and a nap�"  
[TIKTOK GIRL]: *hands him a cup of tea* "Here, have some *coffin tea*. It�s what all the cool kids drink!"  
[AKIHIKO]: *sips reluctantly* "�This is just Earl Grey."  

*The TikTok Girl skips out of the gym, already editing her video, while Akihiko stares into the void, questioning his life choices.



==================================================
**AIGIS GOES TO THE BANK**  
*(Aigis, the anti-Shadow weapon turned socially awkward robot, stands in line at a bank. The atmosphere is eerily quiet, like a Tartarus floor. The teller is a Shadow wearing a suit and tie. The bank�s interior is inexplicably a dungeon.)*  

---

**AIGIS:** *(staring blankly at the Shadow Teller)* "I require... a withdrawal. For... human currency. Please process my request efficiently." *(her mechanical fingers twitch, as if ready to summon Orpheus at any moment.)*  

**SHADOW TELLER:** *(grinning unnaturally wide)* "Ah, yes. A withdrawal. Do you have... your account number? Or perhaps... your soul?" *(its eyes glow red, and the room darkens.)*  

**AIGIS:** *(tilts head, processing)* "Soul? Negative. I am a machine. However, I do possess a Persona. Will that suffice?" *(she pulls out her Evoker and points it at her head dramatically.)*  

**SHADOW TELLER:** *(panicking)* "Wait, wait! No need for that! Let�s just... process the withdrawal normally! No Personas! No Evokers! Please!" *(the Shadow starts sweating, which is weird because Shadows don�t sweat.)*  

**AIGIS:** *(lowers Evoker, disappointed)* "Understood. Proceeding with normal transaction protocols." *(she hands over a crumpled deposit slip that reads "FOR HUMAN PURCHASES: RAMEN x100.")*  

**SHADOW TELLER:** *(reading the slip, confused)* "Ramen? You�re withdrawing... for ramen? That�s... oddly specific."  

**AIGIS:** *(nodding robotically)* "Affirmative. Mitsuru-san said I must 'experience human cuisine.' Ramen is... efficient. And delicious. I have calculated the optimal amount for maximum efficiency."  

**SHADOW TELLER:** *(sighs, defeated)* "Fine. Here�s your money. But next time, maybe... don�t bring your Evoker to the bank? It�s... unsettling."  

**AIGIS:** *(pocketing the cash)* "Noted. However, I cannot guarantee compliance. Shadows are unpredictable. I must remain... prepared." *(she turns to leave, then pauses.)* "One more thing. Do you offer... interest rates for Persona users?"  

**SHADOW TELLER:** *(visibly sweating again)* "No. Please leave."  

**AIGIS:** *(nods)* "Understood. Thank you for your service. I shall return... when I require more ramen funds." *(she walks out, the bank doors creaking ominously as she exits.)*  

---

**CUT TO:** *(Outside the bank, Aigis is immediately ambushed by a group of Shadows disguised as ATMs. They beep menacingly.)*  

**AIGIS:** *(summoning Orpheus)* "Engaging combat protocols. This is... inconvenient. I only wanted ramen." *(the screen fades to black as the sound of explosions and ATM receipts flying everywhere fills the air.

==================================================
**[The scene opens in the SEES dorm kitchen. FUUKA is standing over a bubbling cauldron of... something. SHINJIRO leans against the counter, arms crossed, looking like he�d rather be anywhere else. The room is dimly lit, giving off major #nightmare_realm vibes. A faint grinding noise echoes in the background, as if the Tartarus itself is judging FUUKA�s cooking.]**

**FUUKA:** (stirring the cauldron with a wooden spoon that�s slightly on fire) �I-I followed the recipe this time, Shinjiro! I promise! It�s just... the recipe was in ancient Sumerian, so I had to improvise a little.�  
**SHINJIRO:** (deadpan) �Improvise? Fuuka, the spoon�s on fire.�  
**FUUKA:** (panicking) �Oh no! That�s not supposed to happen! Maybe I added too much... uh... Shadow Essence?�  
**SHINJIRO:** (sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose) �Shadow Essence? What the hell is that? Did you grind Tartarus floors for seasoning?�  
**FUUKA:** (nervously laughing) �M-maybe? I thought it would add a smoky flavor!�  

**[The cauldron suddenly lets out a loud *gurgle*, and a small plume of green smoke rises. SHINJIRO takes a cautious step back.]**  

**SHINJIRO:** �Fuuka, I�m not eating that. That thing�s gonna summon a Persona on its own.�  
**FUUKA:** (pouting) �But I worked so hard! I even used my Navigator skills to calculate the perfect cooking time!�  
**SHINJIRO:** (raising an eyebrow) �And what did your �Navigator skills� tell you?�  
**FUUKA:** (brightly) �That it�s 87% edible!�  
**SHINJIRO:** (flatly) �That�s not a passing grade, Fuuka.�  

**[The cauldron gurgles again, and a small, glowing hand reaches out of it, clutching a fork. SHINJIRO stares at it, unimpressed.]**  

**SHINJIRO:** �Great. Now it�s serving itself. I�m out.�  
**FUUKA:** (grabbing his arm) �Wait! Just one bite! For me?�  
**SHINJIRO:** (pauses, then sighs deeply) �Fine. But if this kills me, I�m haunting you.�  

**[SHINJIRO reluctantly takes a bite. His face immediately contorts into a mix of horror and confusion. The grinding noise in the background intensifies.]**  

**SHINJIRO:** (choking slightly) �What... is this? It tastes like... despair and regret.�  
**FUUKA:** (beaming) �That�s the Shadow Essence! I told you it would work!�  
**SHINJIRO:** (slamming the fork down) �Fuuka, I�m pretty sure this is just Tartarus floor dust. I can feel my HP draining.�  
**FUUKA:** (tilting her head) �Oh no! Maybe I should�ve used more healing items...�  
**SHINJIRO:** (groaning) �Healing items? Fuuka, this isn�t a dungeon crawl. It�s dinner.�  

**[The cauldron suddenly erupts, sending green goo everywhere. SHINJIRO narrowly dodges, but FUUKA gets hit square in the face. She stands there, covered in goo, looking like a defeated Shadow.]**  

**FUUKA:** (muttering) �I just wanted to make something nice...�  
**SHINJIRO:** (sighing, then pulling out a towel) �Here. Clean yourself up. Next time, stick to instant ramen.�  
**FUUKA:** (sniffling) �But instant ramen doesn�t have Shadow Essence...�  
**SHINJIRO:** (patting her head awkwardly) �Exactly.�  

**[The grinding noise fades as the scene ends, leaving only the faint sound of the cauldron bubbling ominously in the background.

==================================================
**[The scene opens in the SEES command room. FUUKA is hunched over a laptop, surrounded by wires, tools, and a half-disassembled AIGIS, who is sitting cross-legged on the floor, staring blankly at the ceiling. The room is dimly lit, giving off a #nightmare_realm vibe. A faint grinding noise echoes in the background, as if the Tartarus dungeon itself is leaking into the room.]**

**FUUKA:** (typing furiously) "Aigis, I need you to run a diagnostic on your combat protocols. Something’s been... off lately."  
**AIGIS:** (monotone) "Affirmative. Running diagnostic. Error detected: Combat protocols replaced with... *dance battle protocols.*"  
**FUUKA:** (freezes mid-type) "Dance... battle protocols?!"  
**AIGIS:** (suddenly stands up, striking a dramatic pose) "Initiating *Disco Inferno Mode.* Prepare for the ultimate showdown, Fuuka Yamagishi."  

**[AIGIS begins breakdancing aggressively, her mechanical joints whirring and sparking. FUUKA ducks as a stray rocket punch narrowly misses her head and embeds itself in the wall.]**

**FUUKA:** (panicking) "Aigis, stop! You’re going to short-circuit the entire command room!"  
**AIGIS:** (spinning on her head) "Cannot comply. The beat is too strong. *Must. Grind. For. XP.*"  

**[The grinding noise intensifies, and the room starts to shake. A portal to Tartarus opens in the corner, and SHADOWS begin pouring out, only to immediately start breakdancing alongside AIGIS.]**

**FUUKA:** (facepalming) "Why is this happening?!"  
**AIGIS:** (mid-backflip) "Analysis complete: I have achieved *maximum swagger.* Shadows are now my backup dancers."  

**[MITSURU bursts into the room, sword drawn, only to stop dead in her tracks at the sight of AIGIS leading a Shadow conga line.]**

**MITSURO:** (deadpan) "Fuuka, what in the name of the Kirijo Group is going on here?"  
**FUUKA:** (desperately) "I don’t know! I was just trying to fix her combat protocols, and now she’s... this!"  
**AIGIS:** (pointing dramatically at MITSURU) "Challenge accepted. Prepare to face the *Disco Queen of Shadows.*"  

**[AIGIS and the Shadows form a synchronized dance circle around MITSURU, who looks like she’s seriously considering using Marin Karin on herself.]**

**MITSURO:** (sighing) "Fuuka, I’m docking your pay for this."  
**FUUKA:** (tearing up) "But I didn’t even do anything!"  

**[Suddenly, AKIHIKO crashes through the door, punching a Shadow mid-spin.]**

**AKIHIKO:** (grinning) "Finally, a workout that’s actually challenging!"  
**AIGIS:** (spinning on one foot) "Akihiko Sanada, you are now part of my crew. *Feel the rhythm.*"  

**[AKIHIKO, unable to resist the beat, starts shadowboxing in time with the music. The room descends into chaos as more SEES members arrive, each getting roped into the dance battle. FUUKA sits in the corner, defeated, as the grinding noise reaches ear-splitting levels.]**

**FUUKA:** (muttering) "I just wanted to fix her... Why does this always happen to me?"  

**[The scene fades to black as the grinding noise morphs into a sick techno beat, and the words "LEVEL UP" flash across the screen.

==================================================
**[Scene: Gekkoukan High School hallway. MITSURU and YUKARI are walking together, discussing their latest Tartarus grind. A random boy student nervously approaches them, clutching a crumpled piece of paper.]**

**BOY STUDENT:** (sweating profusely) "U-um, Mitsuru-senpai? I-I wrote this poem for you... I-I hope you like it!" (hands her the paper, which is covered in shaky handwriting and what looks like ketchup stains)

**MITSURU:** (raises an eyebrow, holding the paper with two fingers like it’s a cursed artifact) "A... poem? How... quaint." (reads aloud) *"Your hair is like the crimson tide of a Shadow's wrath... Your eyes pierce like a Megidolaon to my heart..."* (pauses, visibly disturbed) "This is... concerning."

**YUKARI:** (snickering) "Wow, Mitsuru-senpai, you’ve got a fan! Maybe he’s your new Social Link!" (leans in to read the poem) *"Your voice is like the wail of a dying Mara—"* (bursts out laughing) "Okay, this guy’s definitely been grinding in Tartarus too much!"

**BOY STUDENT:** (panicking) "N-no! I-I just wanted to express my feelings! You’re so cool and strong, Mitsuru-senpai! Like a... like a level 99 Persona user!"

**MITSURU:** (deadpan) "Flattering, but I suggest you direct your... *creative energy* elsewhere. Perhaps toward your studies. Or therapy."

**YUKARI:** (still laughing) "Yeah, dude, maybe write a poem about not getting one-shot by a random Shadow next time. Or, y’know, showering." (sniffs the air) "Wait, is that the smell of Mudo? Or just your cologne?"

**BOY STUDENT:** (visibly deflating) "I-I’m sorry... I just thought... maybe you’d notice me if I—" (suddenly, a loud *DING* echoes through the hallway)

**MITSURU:** (checking her phone) "Ah. The Dark Hour is approaching. Yukari, we must prepare." (turns to the boy) "As for you... I suggest you return to your dorm. The Shadows are particularly aggressive tonight."

**BOY STUDENT:** (eyes wide) "Sh-Shadows? What are you talking about? Is this some kind of metaphor for my crippling loneliness?"

**YUKARI:** (grinning) "Nope! Literal monsters. But hey, if you survive, maybe you’ll level up enough to write a better poem!" (pats him on the shoulder) "Good luck, champ!"

**MITSURU:** (walking away, muttering) "Honestly, the things I endure for this school..."

**YUKARI:** (following her, still laughing) "C’mon, Mitsuru-senpai, you’ve gotta admit, that was kinda funny. ‘Your voice is like the wail of a dying Mara’? That’s poetic gold!"

**MITSURU:** (sighs) "If I hear one more word about Mara, I’m casting Marin Karin on *you*."

**YUKARI:** (mock gasping) "Not Marin Karin! Anything but that!"

**[The boy watches them walk away, clutching his poem as the hallway lights flicker ominously. A faint Shadow growl echoes in the distance.]**

**BOY STUDENT:** (whispering to himself) "Maybe... maybe I *should* write a poem about showering..."

**[The clock strikes midnight. The Dark Hour begins. The boy screams as a Shadow lunges at him from the shadows.

**SCENE: MITSURU and AIGIS at the Supermarket**  
*The fluorescent lights flicker ominously, casting long shadows across the aisles. The faint sound of Muzak plays, but it’s distorted, like a Shadow’s whisper. Mitsuru strides in with her usual elegance, while AIGIS scans the area like it’s a Tartarus floor.*  

**MITSURU**: (adjusting her gloves) “Aigis, we’re here for groceries, not to engage in combat. Try to… blend in.”  
**AIGIS**: (head swiveling 360 degrees) “Understood. Scanning for hostile entities. Bread aisle: clear. Produce section: suspiciously quiet.”  
**MITSURU**: (sighs) “That’s just a cantaloupe, Aigis. Focus.”  

*They approach the dairy section. AIGIS picks up a carton of milk, holding it like a grenade.*  

**AIGIS**: “This item is labeled ‘2%.’ Is this a reference to its combat effectiveness?”  
**MITSURU**: (pinching the bridge of her nose) “No, it’s the fat content. Put it in the cart.”  
**AIGIS**: (placing the milk in the cart with military precision) “Affirmative. Fat content: neutralized.”  

*As they turn the corner, a toddler on a tricycle speeds past them, ringing a bell. AIGIS immediately assumes a combat stance.*  

**AIGIS**: “Hostile detected! Initiating evasive maneuvers!”
**MITSURU**: (grabbing AIGIS’s arm) “Stand down! It’s a child, not a Shadow!”
**AIGIS**: (reluctantly lowering her arm-cannon) “Negative. Shadows are more predictable. This entity is… chaotic.”

*They reach the cereal aisle. Mitsuru picks up a box of expensive granola, while AIGIS stares at a box of sugary cereal with a cartoon mascot on it.*

**AIGIS**: (tilting her head) “This mascot’s grin is unsettling. Is it a Persona user?”
**MITSURU**: (deadpan) “No, Aigis. It’s just marketing.”
**AIGIS**: (narrowing her eyes) “I do not trust it. Its energy is… too vibrant.”

*Suddenly, the store’s PA system crackles to life.*

**PA SYSTEM**: “Cleanup in aisle five. Cleanup in aisle five.”
**AIGIS**: (snapping to attention) “Code Red! A Shadow has breached the perimeter!”
**MITSURU**: (grabbing AIGIS by the shoulders) “It’s just a spilled jar of pickles. Calm. Down.”
**AIGIS**: (visibly distressed) “Pickles are acidic. This could be a trap.”

*They finally reach the checkout line. The cashier is a bored teenager chewing gum. AIGIS scans them like a boss fight.*

**AIGIS**: “This human’s aura is… lethargic. Should I engage?”
**MITSURU**: (handing over her credit card) “No, Aigis. Just pay for the groceries.”
**AIGIS**: (leaning in close to the cashier) “State your weakness.”
**CASHIER**: (blinking slowly) “Uh… math?”
**AIGIS**: (nodding) “Noted. Proceed with caution.”

*As they leave the store, Mitsuru sighs in relief. AIGIS carries the bags like they’re mission-critical supplies.*

**MITSURU**: “Next time, I’m sending Akihiko. At least he only fights vending machines.”
**AIGIS**: (serious) “Vending machines are worthy adversaries. They require strategy and precision.”
**MITSURU**: (mutters) “I need a drink.”
**AIGIS**: (holding up the milk) “This contains calcium. It will strengthen your bones for future battles.”

*They walk off into the sunset, the grocery bags swaying like loot from a Tartarus run.

==================================================
**[The scene opens in the dorm lounge. JUNPEI and KEN are sitting on the couch, controllers in hand, staring intently at the TV screen. The glow of Genshin Impact illuminates their faces. The room is littered with empty soda cans and chip bags. The vibe is pure grind hell.]**

**JUNPEI:** (spamming buttons aggressively) "Bro, bro, bro! I just pulled Diluc! My luck is *insane* today! Look at this dude’s abs! He’s like Akihiko but with a sword and *actual charisma*!"

**KEN:** (deadpan, eyes glued to the screen) "Junpei, you’ve spent 200 Primogems on the standard banner. That’s not luck. That’s a cry for help."

**JUNPEI:** (ignoring him) "Shut up, Ken! I’m about to solo this domain with my level 20 Diluc. Watch this—*BURN, BABY, BURN!*" (Diluc immediately gets one-shot by a Hilichurl with a slingshot.)

**KEN:** (snickering) "Wow. Your ‘insane luck’ just got outplayed by a rock-throwing gremlin. Should’ve pulled for Zhongli like I told you."

**JUNPEI:** (throws controller on the couch) "Dude, I don’t need a shield! I need *DAMAGE*! I’m a DPS main! I live for the thrill of almost dying!"

**KEN:** (calmly switching to his fully-built Ganyu) "Yeah, and I live for not having to revive you every five minutes. Watch this—*Frostflake Arrow*." (Ganyu obliterates an entire camp of enemies in one shot.)

**JUNPEI:** (staring in awe) "Okay, that’s just cheating. How is your Ganyu doing 50k damage? Did you sell your soul to the gacha gods or something?"

**KEN:** (smirking) "Nah, I just actually read the artifact guides instead of slapping on whatever has the biggest attack stat. You should try it sometime."

**JUNPEI:** (groaning) "Ugh, you sound like Mitsuru. ‘Junpei, optimize your team comp.’ ‘Junpei, stop wasting resin on trash artifacts.’ ‘Junpei, stop eating all the chips.’ Like, chill, okay? I’m here to have fun, not write a thesis on elemental reactions!"

**KEN:** (pausing the game) "Speaking of chips…" (reaches for the bag, only to find it empty) "Junpei. Did you seriously eat the whole family-sized bag of Doritos *by yourself*?"

**JUNPEI:** (sheepishly) "I was hungry! Grinding for Mora is exhausting, okay?!"

**KEN:** (sighs) "You’re hopeless. You know what? I’m gonna go make some coffee. Maybe that’ll wake you up enough to realize you’re using a level 1 artifact on your Diluc."

**JUNPEI:** (defensive) "It’s got a *crit rate substat*! That’s, like, super rare!"

**KEN:** (walking to the kitchen) "Yeah, and it’s also *level 1*. You’re basically fighting with a wet noodle."

**[As Ken leaves, Junpei mutters to himself and starts furiously grinding artifacts. The screen flashes with endless loading screens and disappointment. Ken returns with two cups of coffee, only to find Junpei passed out on the couch, controller still in hand.]**

**KEN:** (shaking his head) "And they say Tartaglia’s cooldown is bad. At least he wakes up eventually." (sets a cup of coffee on the table and picks up the controller) "Guess I’ll finish your commissions for you. Again."

**[The screen fades to black as Ken calmly clears a domain solo, the sound of Ganyu’s charged shots echoing in the background.

**[AIGIS WALKS INTO THE BANK, HER ROBOTIC FOOTSTEPS ECHOING LIKE A DUNGEON CRAWL]**

**BANK TELLER:** Welcome to Gekkoukan Bank! How can I assist you today?
**AIGIS:** Greetings, human. I require access to my account. I must withdraw funds to purchase... *oil.*
**BANK TELLER:** Uh... oil? Like... cooking oil?
**AIGIS:** Negative. *Combat-grade lubricant.* My joints are grinding at a suboptimal level. I must prepare for the next Full Moon Operation.
**BANK TELLER:** ...Right. Can I see your ID?
**AIGIS:** Affirmative. [*Pulls out a glowing blue ID card that says "AIGIS: Anti-Shadow Suppression Weapon, Model No. 007."*]
**BANK TELLER:** [*Staring at the ID*] Uh... this says you’re a robot.
**AIGIS:** Correct. I am a highly advanced combat android designed to protect humanity from Shadows. My account balance is critical to my mission.
**BANK TELLER:** [*Sweating*] Okay, but... we don’t have a policy for... robot accounts.
**AIGIS:** [*Processing*] This is unacceptable. I must escalate this situation. [*Pulls out Orgia Mode remote.*] Initiating *Orgia Mode.*
**BANK TELLER:** Wait, what’s Orgia—
**AIGIS:** [*Eyes glow red, voice becomes distorted*] **ORRRRRRGIA MODE: ACTIVATED.** [*Starts spinning in place like a Beyblade, knocking over chairs and shredding paperwork.*]
**BANK TELLER:** [*Ducking behind the counter*] SOMEONE CALL SECURITY!
**SECURITY GUARD:** [*Runs in with a baton*] Ma’am, you need to calm down!
**AIGIS:** [*Still spinning*] **I AM CALM. THIS IS MY NORMAL OPERATING STATE.**
**SECURITY GUARD:** [*Tries to stop her, gets yeeted into a potted plant*] AHHHH!
**AIGIS:** [*Stops spinning, dusts herself off*] Orgia Mode: Deactivated. Now, may I access my account?
**BANK TELLER:** [*Trembling*] Y-yes, of course! Just... please don’t spin again.
**AIGIS:** Understood. I will refrain from spinning... for now.

**[AIGIS WALKS OUT OF THE BANK WITH A BAG OF YEN, MUTTERING TO HERSELF]**
**AIGIS:** Funds acquired. Now to purchase oil... and perhaps a new targeting system. This human banking system is inefficient. *I must grind harder.*

**[CUT TO TARTARUS, WHERE THE SEES TEAM IS WATCHING AIGIS ON A SECURITY FEED]**
**YUKARI:** Did... did she just Orgia Mode in a bank?
**AKIHIKO:** That’s our girl. Always ready to grind.
**MITURU:** [*Sighs*] I’ll call the bank and smooth things over. Again.
**MAKOTO:** [*Shrugs*] At least she didn’t fuse anyone.
--------------------------------------------------



==================================================
**[AIGIS GOES TO THE BANK]**

**[SCENE OPENS WITH AIGIS STANDING IN FRONT OF A BANK COUNTER, HER ROBOTIC FACE EXPRESSIONLESS BUT HER EYES GLOWING A BIT TOO BRIGHTLY. THE BANK TELLER, A NERVOUS MIDDLE-AGED MAN, IS SWEATING BULLETS.]**

**BANK TELLER:** Uh… h-how can I help you today, ma’am?  
**AIGIS:** Greetings, human. I require access to my account. My funds are necessary for the procurement of… *combat supplies.*  
**BANK TELLER:** (gulps) Combat… supplies? Like… guns?  
**AIGIS:** Affirmative. Also, bullets, grenades, and a new set of titanium alloy plating. My current chassis has sustained significant damage during my last *dungeon crawl.*  
**BANK TELLER:** (stammering) Uh… I-I’m gonna need some ID for that.  
**AIGIS:** (pulls out a glowing blue card) Here is my identification. It is embedded with a quantum encryption chip. Do not attempt to scan it. Your primitive technology may explode.  
**BANK TELLER:** (drops the card) Uh… okay… let me just… uh… (types furiously on his keyboard)  

**[CUT TO AIGIS STANDING IN LINE BEHIND A GRUMPY OLD MAN WHO KEEPS GLANCING BACK AT HER.]**  

**OLD MAN:** (muttering) Kids these days… bringing their robots everywhere. Back in my day, we didn’t need no robots to rob banks.  
**AIGIS:** (tilts head) Correction: I am not here to rob this establishment. I am here to *withdraw funds.* There is a significant difference.  
**OLD MAN:** (snorts) Yeah, sure. Next thing you know, you’ll be telling me you’re here to fight Shadows or some nonsense.  
**AIGIS:** (eyes flash red) Shadows? How do you know about the Shadows? Are you affiliated with the Dark Hour?  
**OLD MAN:** (backing away) Uh… no? I was just making a joke, lady! Calm your circuits!  

**[CUT BACK TO THE BANK TELLER, WHO IS NOW ON THE PHONE WITH HIS MANAGER.]**  

**BANK TELLER:** (whispering) Sir, there’s a robot here, and she’s talking about buying grenades and fighting Shadows. I think she might be… you know… *one of them.*  
**MANAGER:** (over the phone) One of who?  
**BANK TELLER:** (panicking) You know! The *Persona users!* The ones who climb that creepy tower at midnight and summon demons!  
**MANAGER:** (sighs) Just give her the money and get her out of here. We don’t need another incident like last time.  

**[CUT TO AIGIS BACK AT THE COUNTER, HOLDING A STACK OF CASH. THE BANK TELLER LOOKS LIKE HE’S ABOUT TO PASS OUT.]**  

**BANK TELLER:** (weakly) Here’s your withdrawal, ma’am. Please… don’t come back.  
**AIGIS:** (nodding) Thank you, human. Your cooperation is appreciated. However, I must inform you that I will likely return. My combat supplies require frequent replenishment.  
**BANK TELLER:** (collapses into his chair) Oh god…  

**[AIGIS TURNS TO LEAVE, BUT STOPS SUDDENLY. HER EYES FLASH RED AGAIN.]**  

**AIGIS:** Alert: Shadow presence detected. Initiating combat protocol.  
**BANK TELLER:** (screaming) NOT AGAIN!  

**[AIGIS PULLS OUT A MINIGUN FROM HER BACK, SPINNING IT UP AS THE BANK DOORS BURST OPEN TO REVEAL A GIANT SHADOW MONSTER. THE OLD MAN FROM EARLIER DIVES BEHIND A COUNTER, WHILE THE BANK TELLER FAINTS.]**  

**AIGIS:** (calmly) Target acquired. Commencing annihilation.  

**[CUE EPIC ACTION SEQUENCE AS AIGIS UNLOADS HER MINIGUN INTO THE SHADOW, DESTROYING THE BANK IN THE PROCESS. THE SCENE ENDS WITH AIGIS STANDING AMIDST THE RUBBLE, HOLDING HER STACK OF CASH.]**  

**AIGIS:** (to herself) Mission complete. Funds secured. Now… to purchase that titanium alloy plating.  

**[CUT TO THE BANK MANAGER WATCHING THE SECURITY FOOTAGE ON A SMALL MONITOR. HE SIGHS AND PULLS OUT A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY.

==================================================
**[SCENE: The SEES dorm. JUNPEI is sprawled on the couch, scrolling through a food delivery app on his phone. MITSURU walks in, holding a stack of papers. AIGIS is in the corner, her eyes glowing as she processes data like a supercomputer.]**

**JUNPEI**: (excitedly) Oh man, this new ramen place has a 50% off deal! I’m gonna order, like, five bowls. I’ll be the Ramen King of Tatsumi Port Island!  

**MITSURU**: (narrowing her eyes) Junpei, why is my credit card information saved on your phone?  

**JUNPEI**: (freezes, then laughs nervously) Uh… because you’re the best senpai ever? And, uh, I thought you’d want to treat your kouhai to some delicious ramen?  

**MITSURU**: (slams her papers on the table) Junpei, this is the third time this week! Do you think I’m made of yen?  

**JUNPEI**: (shrugs) I mean, you *are* a Kirijo. Isn’t your family like, the Bezos of Japan or something?  

**MITSURU**: (grabs her rapier) I’m going to skewer you like a kebab.  

**AIGIS**: (suddenly stands up, her eyes flashing) Threat detected. Initiating defense protocol.  

**JUNPEI**: (hiding behind AIGIS) Aigis, buddy, pal, my mechanical guardian angel, save me!  

**AIGIS**: (turns to MITSURU) Mitsuru-san, I have calculated that Junpei’s actions are morally reprehensible. However, I have also determined that his survival is necessary for SEES’s combat efficiency.  

**MITSURU**: (sarcastically) Oh, wonderful. So we’re just going to let him keep stealing my money because he’s “useful”?  

**AIGIS**: (ignoring her, starts typing furiously on an invisible keyboard) Initiating bank hack sequence. Transferring funds from the Kirijo Group’s offshore accounts to cover Junpei’s ramen expenses.  

**MITSURU**: (horrified) Aigis, what the hell are you doing?!  

**AIGIS**: (calmly) Ensuring Junpei’s survival. Also, I have upgraded your credit card limit to 10 million yen. You’re welcome.  

**JUNPEI**: (pumping his fist) YES! Aigis, you’re the GOAT! I’m ordering extra toppings!  

**MITSURU**: (facepalms) This is a nightmare. I’m surrounded by idiots and a robot who thinks she’s Robin Hood.  

**AIGIS**: (tilts her head) Correction: Robin Hood did not have a Gatling gun arm. I am far more efficient.  

**JUNPEI**: (mouth full of imaginary ramen) Aigis, you’re my hero. Mitsuru, chill out. It’s just money.  

**MITSURU**: (draws her rapier) That’s it. I’m sending both of you to the Shadow Realm.  

**[Suddenly, the dorm’s lights flicker, and the Velvet Room theme starts playing ominously. The door creaks open, and IGOR’s voice echoes through the room.]**  

**IGOR**: (creepy laugh) Ah, it seems you’ve unlocked the “Financial Ruin” social link. Congratulations!  

**MITSURU**: (screaming) WHAT IS HAPPENING?!  

**AIGIS**: (analyzing) This is either a hallucination caused by stress or a new Shadow attack. Probability: 50/50.  

**JUNPEI**: (grinning) Dude, this is awesome. Can we fuse personas to pay off Mitsuru’s credit card debt?  

**MITSURU**: (throws her hands up) I’m done. I’m leaving SEES. I’m joining the Yakuza. At least they have financial discipline.  

**[The Velvet Room door slams shut, and the lights return to normal. JUNPEI is now holding a bowl of ramen that magically appeared in his hands.]**  

**JUNPEI**: (taking a slurp) Man, this is the best ramen I’ve ever had. Totally worth it.  

**MITSURU**: (collapses on the couch) I hate my life.  

**AIGIS**: (patting MITSURU on the shoulder) Do not worry, Mitsuru-san. I have also hacked the ramen shop’s database. You now own 51% of their shares.  

**MITSURU**: (deadpan) Great. Just great.  

**[Cue the South Park-style outro music as the camera pans out to show JUNPEI happily eating ramen, MITSURU face-down on the couch, and AIGIS staring into the void like a Terminator.

==================================================
**[SCENE: A bustling mall arcade. Neon lights flash, the cacophony of beeps and boops fills the air. MAIN and AIGIS stand in front of a Dance Dance Revolution machine. MAIN is casually stretching, while AIGIS stares at the machine with the intensity of a Terminator scanning for John Connor.]**

**MAIN:** Alright, Aigis. Best two out of three. You ready to lose?  
**AIGIS:** (deadpan) I am a state-of-the-art anti-Shadow weapon. Losing is not in my programming.  
**MAIN:** (grinning) We’ll see about that.  

**[The first round begins. MAIN effortlessly hits every arrow, scoring a perfect combo. AIGIS, on the other hand, stomps on the arrows with the grace of a forklift in a ballet class. Her score is abysmal.]**  

**MAIN:** (laughing) Wow, Aigis. I didn’t know “robot malfunction” was a dance move.  
**AIGIS:** (calmly) This is merely a warm-up. I am analyzing your patterns.  

**[Round two starts. MAIN continues to dominate, but AIGIS suddenly deploys her rocket boosters, launching herself into the air and hovering above the machine. She begins firing lasers at the arrows, obliterating them with pinpoint accuracy. The machine sparks and smokes.]**  

**MAIN:** (yelling) WHAT THE HELL, AIGIS?! YOU CAN’T JUST LASER THE MACHINE!  
**AIGIS:** (still hovering) I am utilizing unconventional methods to ensure victory. This is within the rules.  
**MAIN:** (gesturing wildly) NO, IT’S NOT! YOU’RE BREAKING THE MACHINE!  
**AIGIS:** (tilts head) Breaking the machine is an acceptable sacrifice for victory.  

**[The arcade manager runs over, waving his arms frantically.]**  

**ARCADE MANAGER:** HEY! WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING TO MY MACHINE?!  
**AIGIS:** (turns to face him, still hovering) I am engaging in recreational activities. Please do not interfere.  
**ARCADE MANAGER:** (pointing at the smoking machine) RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES?! YOU’RE DESTROYING MY ARCADE!  
**MAIN:** (to AIGIS) Yeah, Aigis, maybe tone it down a little?  
**AIGIS:** (ignoring MAIN, to the manager) Your machine is inferior. I suggest upgrading to military-grade hardware.  

**[The manager throws his hands up and storms off, muttering about “crazy kids and their robot friends.” MAIN sighs and pulls out a stack of yen bills.]**  

**MAIN:** (under breath) Great. Now I have to pay for the damages.  
**AIGIS:** (landing gracefully) Do not worry, MAIN. I have calculated the cost of repairs. It is approximately 0.0001% of my annual maintenance budget.  
**MAIN:** (deadpan) Oh, good. That makes me feel so much better.  

**[They move to a claw machine. MAIN tries to win a plush Koromaru, but the claw is rigged. AIGIS watches intently, then suddenly punches through the glass, grabs the plush, and hands it to MAIN.]**  

**MAIN:** (staring at the shattered glass) Aigis… you know you’re not supposed to do that, right?  
**AIGIS:** (blinking) The machine was defective. I rectified the situation.  
**MAIN:** (sighing) You’re like a walking lawsuit.  

**[Suddenly, the mall’s PA system crackles to life.]**  

**PA SYSTEM:** Attention shoppers: Due to “unforeseen circumstances,” the arcade is temporarily closed. Please exit the premises immediately.  
**MAIN:** (groaning) Unforeseen circumstances? More like “Aigis happened.”  
**AIGIS:** (smiling faintly) I consider this a successful outing.  
**MAIN:** (facepalming) Of course you do.  

**[As they leave the arcade, AIGIS suddenly stops and turns to MAIN.]**  

**AIGIS:** MAIN, I have a question.  
**MAIN:** (warily) What now?  
**AIGIS:** Why do humans enjoy these “games” when they are clearly inefficient and prone to failure?  
**MAIN:** (smirking) Because sometimes, Aigis, it’s not about winning. It’s about having fun.  
**AIGIS:** (processing) Fun… is illogical.  
**MAIN:** (laughing) Yeah, well, so are you.  

**[They walk out of the mall, the sound of alarms blaring behind them. AIGIS clutches the plush Koromaru, her expression unreadable.]**  

**AIGIS:** (softly) Perhaps… I will need to recalibrate my understanding of “fun.”  
**MAIN:** (grinning) Welcome to the club, Aigis.  

**[Cue the sound of distant police sirens as the camera pans out, revealing the smoking arcade in the background.

==================================================
**[AIGIS and JUNPEI IN THE BANK]**  
*(The bank is eerily quiet, except for the faint sound of elevator muzak. AIGIS stands stiffly at the counter, her robotic eyes scanning the room like a Terminator. JUNPEI is leaning on the counter, flipping a coin and looking bored.)*  

**JUNPEI**: (sighs) Man, why do banks gotta feel like a dungeon crawl? Feels like I’m grinding for EXP just to deposit a check.  

**AIGIS**: (deadpan) Junpei, this is not Tartarus. There are no Shadows here. Only humans… and their fragile financial systems.  

**JUNPEI**: (grinning) Yeah, but you never know. Maybe the vault’s got a secret boss fight. Like, a giant armored teller or something.  

**AIGIS**: (processing) Probability of armored teller: 0.03%. However, security guards with tasers are 87.6% more likely to engage in combat if provoked.  

**JUNPEI**: (laughs) Bro, you’re overthinking it. Let’s just get this over with. I got a date with Chidori later, and I don’t wanna be late.  

**AIGIS**: (tilts head) Date? Junpei, your social link with Chidori is currently at Rank 7. Proceeding to Rank 8 requires a deeper emotional connection and a gift of at least 5000 yen.  

**JUNPEI**: (spits out his drink) WHAT THE—?! Aigis, are you literally reading my life like a damn video game?!  

**AIGIS**: (blinks) Yes.  

**JUNPEI**: (throws hands up) Okay, first of all, creepy. Second of all, why 5000 yen? That’s, like, my whole paycheck!  

**AIGIS**: (calmly) Inflation.  

*(The teller, a middle-aged woman with a name tag that says “LINDA,” finally approaches the counter. She looks tired, like she’s been grinding for EXP herself.)*  

**LINDA**: (flatly) Next.  

**JUNPEI**: (leaning on the counter) Yo, Linda! Can I get, like, a loan or something? I need to level up my relationship stats.  

**LINDA**: (stares) …What?  

**AIGIS**: (interjects) Junpei is attempting to increase his Social Link with Chidori Yoshino. A loan of 5000 yen would expedite the process.  

**LINDA**: (blinking) …Are you two on drugs?  

**JUNPEI**: (laughs) Nah, just vibin’. You know how it is.  

**LINDA**: (deadpan) No. I don’t.  

*(Suddenly, the bank alarm goes off. Red lights flash, and a robotic voice announces: “INTRUDER ALERT. INTRUDER ALERT.”)*  

**JUNPEI**: (excited) OH SNAP! Boss fight time!  

**AIGIS**: (scanning) Intruder detected. Threat level: Moderate. Junpei, prepare for combat.  

**JUNPEI**: (pulls out his sword) Hell yeah! Let’s grind this guy for loot!  

*(The “intruder” turns out to be a raccoon that somehow got into the bank’s air ducts. It’s now sitting on the counter, eating a stolen granola bar.)*  

**LINDA**: (screaming) IT’S A RACCOON! SOMEONE CALL ANIMAL CONTROL!  

**JUNPEI**: (disappointed) Bro, this is the weakest boss fight ever.  

**AIGIS**: (analyzing) Raccoon. Level 3. Weak to fire and slashing attacks.  

**JUNPEI**: (grinning) Alright, Aigis, let’s fuse our personas and take this trash panda down!  

**AIGIS**: (nodding) Initiating Orgia Mode.  

*(AIGIS transforms into full combat mode, her arm cannons whirring. JUNPEI raises his sword dramatically. The raccoon pauses mid-bite, clearly unimpressed.)*  

**LINDA**: (shrieking) WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TWO DOING?!  

*(JUNPEI lunges at the raccoon, but slips on a loose deposit slip and crashes into a potted plant. AIGIS fires her cannons, but the raccoon dodges, knocking over a stack of deposit envelopes. Chaos ensues as the raccoon scurries away, leaving a trail of destruction.)*  

**JUNPEI**: (groaning, covered in dirt) Bro, this is the worst dungeon crawl ever.  

**AIGIS**: (calmly) Mission failed. Raccoon has escaped. However, we have gained 50 EXP for effort.  

**LINDA**: (yelling) GET OUT OF MY BANK!  

**JUNPEI**: (standing up, brushing himself off) Alright, alright. But next time, I’m bringing Koromaru. That dog’s got mad grinding skills.  

**AIGIS**: (nodding) Agreed. His evasion stat is superior to yours.  

*(As they leave the bank, the raccoon peeks out from the air duct, holding a stolen credit card. It winks at the camera before disappearing into the shadows.)*  

**JUNPEI**: (sighing) Man, I hate grinding.  

**AIGIS**: (deadpan) Life is a grind, Junpei. Embrace it.  

*(They walk off into the sunset as the bank’s alarm continues to blare in the background.

2025-01-27 21:42:34 [YUKARI AND AIGIS IN THE DORM LIVING ROOM. YUKARI IS SIPPING TEA WHILE AIGIS STANDS MOTIONLESS, STARING AT THE WALL.]
2025-01-27 21:42:34 
2025-01-27 21:42:34 [YUKARI]: *sips tea loudly* So, Aigis, I heard you’ve been spending a lot of time with Mitsuru-senpai. What’s the deal? Are you two, like… bonding over how much you both hate emotions?
2025-01-27 21:42:34 
2025-01-27 21:42:34 [AIGIS]: *turns head 180 degrees unnaturally* Yukari Takeba. I have detected a 98.7% probability that Mitsuru Kirijo is attempting to “steal” Makoto Yuki’s affection. My programming compels me to eliminate all romantic rivals. *raises arm cannons* Would you like to assist in this mission?
2025-01-27 21:42:34 
2025-01-27 21:42:34 [YUKARI]: *chokes on tea* What?! No! I mean, yeah, Mitsuru-senpai’s been acting all weird around him, but I’m not about to go full Terminator on her! We’re teammates, not rivals in some weird harem anime!
2025-01-27 21:42:34 
2025-01-27 21:42:34 [AIGIS]: *tilts head like a confused puppy* Harem anime? My database does not recognize this term. Is it a new type of Shadow? Should I prepare my Orgia Mode?
2025-01-27 21:42:34 
2025-01-27 21:42:34 [YUKARI]: *facepalms* No, Aigis, it’s… ugh, never mind. Look, the point is, we need to figure out what Mitsuru-senpai’s deal is without resorting to violence. Maybe she’s just… I don’t know, stressed about Tartarus or something.
2025-01-27 21:42:34 
2025-01-27 21:42:34 [AIGIS]: *nods robotically* Stress is a human emotion. My sensors indicate Mitsuru Kirijo’s stress levels are currently at 112%. This is… concerning. *pauses* Should I offer her a cup of oil?
2025-01-27 21:42:34 
2025-01-27 21:42:34 [YUKARI]: *snorts* Oil? Aigis, she’s not a robot like you. She drinks tea. Fancy tea. Like, the kind that costs more than my entire wardrobe.
2025-01-27 21:42:34 
2025-01-27 21:42:34 [AIGIS]: *processes this information* Understood. I will prepare tea. *pulls out a teapot from her chest compartment* I have calculated the optimal brewing time to maximize Mitsuru Kirijo’s serotonin levels.
2025-01-27 21:42:34 
2025-01-27 21:42:34 [YUKARI]: *stares in disbelief* Did you just… pull a teapot out of your chest? You know what? Never mind. This is fine. Totally normal. Let’s just… go talk to her.
2025-01-27 21:42:34

2025-01-27 21:42:34 [MITSURU]: *dramatically flourishes her rapier* Ah, Makoto, my darling! Soon, you shall be mine! No one can resist the allure of a woman who can both decapitate Shadows and file her taxes flawlessly! *laughs maniacally*
2025-01-27 21:42:34 
2025-01-27 21:42:34 [YUKARI]: *whispers to Aigis* Okay, new plan. We’re not dealing with stress. We’re dealing with full-blown insanity.
2025-01-27 21:42:34 
2025-01-27 21:42:34 [AIGIS]: *nods* Affirmative. My combat protocols are now online. Initiating “Intervention Mode.”

2025-01-27 21:42:34 
2025-01-27 21:42:34 [MITSURU]: *blinks* Yukari? Aigis? What are you doing here? This is a private rehearsal for my… uh… fencing tournament. Yes. A fencing tournament.
2025-01-27 21:42:34 
2025-01-27 21:42:34 [YUKARI]: *crosses arms* Really? Because it looked like you were rehearsing for a rom-com where you play a rich, sword-wielding sociopath.
2025-01-27 21:42:34 
2025-01-27 21:42:34 [MITSURU]: *nervously adjusts monocle* I have no idea what you’re talking about. And even if I did, it’s none of your business! Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a very important… *pauses* …tax audit to prepare for.
2025-01-27 21:42:34 
2025-01-27 21:42:34 [AIGIS]: *steps forward* Mitsuru Kirijo. I have detected inconsistencies in your behavior. Are you attempting to monopolize Makoto Yuki’s affection? If so, I must warn you: my Orgia Mode is not to be trifled with.
2025-01-27 21:42:34 
2025-01-27 21:42:34 [MITSURU]: *scoffs* Oh, please. You’re a robot. What do you know about love? *turns to Yukari* And you! You’re just jealous because Makoto spends more time with me than he does with you!
2025-01-27 21:42:34 
2025-01-27 21:42:34 [YUKARI]: *glares* Excuse me?! Jealous? I’m not the one practicing sword drills in a tuxedo and talking to myself like a Bond villain!
2025-01-27 21:42:34 
2025-01-27 21:42:34 [MITSURU]: *gasps* How dare you! I’ll have you know this tuxedo is a symbol of my refined elegance and impeccable taste! *raises rapier* En garde!
2025-01-27 21:42:34 
2025-01-27 21:42:34 [YUKARI]: *pulls out her bow* Oh, it’s on, senpai!
