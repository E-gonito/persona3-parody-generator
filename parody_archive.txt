**MITSURU:** (leaning in, her voice low and dangerous) "I heard that."  

**JUNPEI:** (sweating profusely, trying to backpedal) "N-no, no! I mean, uh, I was just saying... Hu Tao is *overrated*! Yeah, totally overrated! I donï¿½t even need her! Iï¿½ll delete the game right now!"  

**MITSURU:** (raising an eyebrow, her Persona still looming behind her) "Oh? So youï¿½re admitting it was a waste of *my* money?"  

**JUNPEI:** (nervously laughing) "Waste? No, no, no! It was an... *investment*! In, uh, team morale! Yeah, thatï¿½s it! Team morale! You know how stressed we all get fighting Shadows and stuff. Genshin is, like, therapeutic!"  

**MITSURU:** (deadpan) "Therapeutic. For *you*. While Iï¿½m out here funding your ï¿½therapyï¿½ with my inheritance."  

**JUNPEI:** (grinning sheepishly) "Hey, come on, Mitsuru-senpai! Youï¿½re rich! Whatï¿½s a little $500 between friends? Besides, Iï¿½ll totally pay you back! Iï¿½ll... uh... do your laundry for a month! No, two months!"  

**MITSURU:** (sighing, pinching the bridge of her nose) "Junpei, I donï¿½t need you doing my laundry. I need you to stop treating my credit card like itï¿½s your personal gacha fund."  

**JUNPEI:** (muttering) "But itï¿½s so convenient..."  

**MITSURU:** (snapping her fingers, causing a small icicle to form on the tip of Junpeiï¿½s nose) "What was that?"  

**JUNPEI:** (flinching) "Nothing! I said nothing! Look, Iï¿½ll stop! I promise! No more gacha! No more Hu Tao! No more... uh... anything!"  

**MITSURU:** (narrowing her eyes) "Good. Because if I see one more charge on my statement, Iï¿½m not just freezing your phone. Iï¿½m freezing *you*."  

**JUNPEI:** (gulping) "Understood. Crystal clear. No more gacha. Got it."  

*(Mitsuru turns to leave, her Persona dissipating into the air. Junpei waits until sheï¿½s out of sight before pulling out a second phone from under the couch cushion.)*  

**JUNPEI:** (whispering to himself) "Thank goodness I had a backup... Now, where was I? Oh yeah, *one more pull*..."  

*(Suddenly, the room temperature drops. Junpei looks up to see Mitsuru standing in the doorway, her eyes glowing brighter than ever.)*  

**MITSURU:** (smiling sweetly, but with an edge of menace) "Did I stutter?"  

**JUNPEI:** (screaming, dropping the phone) "ITï¿½S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE!"  

*(The screen fades to black as the sound of ice cracking fills the air.)*  

**TO BE CONTINUED...?

**SCENE: AKIHIKO GOES TO THE GYM AND ENCOUNTERS AN ANNOYING TIKTOK GIRL**  

[AKIHIKO]: *walks into the gym, protein shake in hand, ready to punch some demons and lift some weights*  
[AKIHIKO]: (to himself) "Alright, time to get swole. Shadows donï¿½t stand a chance against these gains."  

*Suddenly, a loud, high-pitched voice echoes through the gym.*  

[TIKTOK GIRL]: *holding a phone on a selfie stick* "OMG, gym vibes! Whoï¿½s ready for a *hot girl summer*?!" *starts doing exaggerated lunges in front of the mirror*  
[AKIHIKO]: *stares, visibly confused* "Uhï¿½ is this a new Shadow? Itï¿½sï¿½ loud."  

[TIKTOK GIRL]: *notices Akihiko* "OMG, youï¿½re so ripped! Can you spot me while I do this TikTok trend? Itï¿½s called the *Coffin Dance Challenge*!" *starts lying on the bench press, pretending to be in a coffin*  
[AKIHIKO]: *sweating nervously* "Iï¿½ donï¿½t think thatï¿½s how bench presses work. Also, why are you holding a cup of tea?"  

[TIKTOK GIRL]: *sips tea dramatically* "Itï¿½s *coffin tea*, duh! Itï¿½s aesthetic! Now, can you pretend to be a mourner and cry while I do this?"  
[AKIHIKO]: *visibly distressed* "I donï¿½t think my Social Link with you is high enough for thisï¿½"  

*Suddenly, the gym lights flicker, and a Shadow emerges from the mirror.*  

[SHADOW]: *in a monotone voice* "I am the Shadow of Cringeï¿½ the embodiment of your deepest regretsï¿½ like that time you posted a thirst trap and only got three likes."  
[TIKTOK GIRL]: *gasps* "OMG, thatï¿½s so relatable! Can I film this for my *Shadow Hunters* series? Itï¿½s gonna go viral!"  

[AKIHIKO]: *pulls out his Evoker* "Alright, time to summon Caesar and end this nightmare."  
[CAESAR]: *appears, flexing dramatically* "You called, my king?"  
[AKIHIKO]: "Yeah, take this Shadow down before I lose my will to live."  

*Caesar charges at the Shadow, but the TikTok Girl jumps in front of the camera.*  

[TIKTOK GIRL]: "Wait, wait, wait! Let me get a selfie with the Persona first! Hashtag *Sleep Paralysis Gang*!"  
[AKIHIKO]: *facepalms* "This is worse than fighting Nyxï¿½"  

*The Shadow, annoyed by the TikTok Girlï¿½s antics, suddenly self-destructs out of sheer embarrassment.*  

[SHADOW]: *exploding* "I canï¿½tï¿½ take it anymoreï¿½ the cringeï¿½ itï¿½s too strongï¿½"  
[TIKTOK GIRL]: *filming the explosion* "OMG, that was so cinematic! This is gonna get me, like, a million followers!"  

[AKIHIKO]: *collapses on a bench, exhausted* "I need a protein shake and a napï¿½"  
[TIKTOK GIRL]: *hands him a cup of tea* "Here, have some *coffin tea*. Itï¿½s what all the cool kids drink!"  
[AKIHIKO]: *sips reluctantly* "ï¿½This is just Earl Grey."  

*The TikTok Girl skips out of the gym, already editing her video, while Akihiko stares into the void, questioning his life choices.

**AIGIS GOES TO THE BANK**  
*(Aigis, the anti-Shadow weapon turned socially awkward robot, stands in line at a bank. The atmosphere is eerily quiet, like a Tartarus floor. The teller is a Shadow wearing a suit and tie. The bank’s interior is inexplicably a dungeon.)*  

---

**AIGIS:** *(staring blankly at the Shadow Teller)* "I require... a withdrawal. For... human currency. Please process my request efficiently." *(her mechanical fingers twitch, as if ready to summon Orpheus at any moment.)*  

**SHADOW TELLER:** *(grinning unnaturally wide)* "Ah, yes. A withdrawal. Do you have... your account number? Or perhaps... your soul?" *(its eyes glow red, and the room darkens.)*  

**AIGIS:** *(tilts head, processing)* "Soul? Negative. I am a machine. However, I do possess a Persona. Will that suffice?" *(she pulls out her Evoker and points it at her head dramatically.)*  

**SHADOW TELLER:** *(panicking)* "Wait, wait! No need for that! Let’s just... process the withdrawal normally! No Personas! No Evokers! Please!" *(the Shadow starts sweating, which is weird because Shadows don’t sweat.)*  

**AIGIS:** *(lowers Evoker, disappointed)* "Understood. Proceeding with normal transaction protocols." *(she hands over a crumpled deposit slip that reads "FOR HUMAN PURCHASES: RAMEN x100.")*  

**SHADOW TELLER:** *(reading the slip, confused)* "Ramen? You’re withdrawing... for ramen? That’s... oddly specific."  

**AIGIS:** *(nodding robotically)* "Affirmative. Mitsuru-san said I must 'experience human cuisine.' Ramen is... efficient. And delicious. I have calculated the optimal amount for maximum efficiency."  

**SHADOW TELLER:** *(sighs, defeated)* "Fine. Here’s your money. But next time, maybe... don’t bring your Evoker to the bank? It’s... unsettling."  

**AIGIS:** *(pocketing the cash)* "Noted. However, I cannot guarantee compliance. Shadows are unpredictable. I must remain... prepared." *(she turns to leave, then pauses.)* "One more thing. Do you offer... interest rates for Persona users?"  

**SHADOW TELLER:** *(visibly sweating again)* "No. Please leave."  

**AIGIS:** *(nods)* "Understood. Thank you for your service. I shall return... when I require more ramen funds." *(she walks out, the bank doors creaking ominously as she exits.)*  

---

**CUT TO:** *(Outside the bank, Aigis is immediately ambushed by a group of Shadows disguised as ATMs. They beep menacingly.)*  

**AIGIS:** *(summoning Orpheus)* "Engaging combat protocols. This is... inconvenient. I only wanted ramen." *(the screen fades to black as the sound of explosions and ATM receipts flying everywhere fills the air.

==================================================
**[The scene opens in the SEES dorm kitchen. FUUKA is standing over a bubbling cauldron of... something. SHINJIRO leans against the counter, arms crossed, looking like he’d rather be anywhere else. The room is dimly lit, giving off major #nightmare_realm vibes. A faint grinding noise echoes in the background, as if the Tartarus itself is judging FUUKA’s cooking.]**

**FUUKA:** (stirring the cauldron with a wooden spoon that’s slightly on fire) “I-I followed the recipe this time, Shinjiro! I promise! It’s just... the recipe was in ancient Sumerian, so I had to improvise a little.”  
**SHINJIRO:** (deadpan) “Improvise? Fuuka, the spoon’s on fire.”  
**FUUKA:** (panicking) “Oh no! That’s not supposed to happen! Maybe I added too much... uh... Shadow Essence?”  
**SHINJIRO:** (sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose) “Shadow Essence? What the hell is that? Did you grind Tartarus floors for seasoning?”  
**FUUKA:** (nervously laughing) “M-maybe? I thought it would add a smoky flavor!”  

**[The cauldron suddenly lets out a loud *gurgle*, and a small plume of green smoke rises. SHINJIRO takes a cautious step back.]**  

**SHINJIRO:** “Fuuka, I’m not eating that. That thing’s gonna summon a Persona on its own.”  
**FUUKA:** (pouting) “But I worked so hard! I even used my Navigator skills to calculate the perfect cooking time!”  
**SHINJIRO:** (raising an eyebrow) “And what did your ‘Navigator skills’ tell you?”  
**FUUKA:** (brightly) “That it’s 87% edible!”  
**SHINJIRO:** (flatly) “That’s not a passing grade, Fuuka.”  

**[The cauldron gurgles again, and a small, glowing hand reaches out of it, clutching a fork. SHINJIRO stares at it, unimpressed.]**  

**SHINJIRO:** “Great. Now it’s serving itself. I’m out.”  
**FUUKA:** (grabbing his arm) “Wait! Just one bite! For me?”  
**SHINJIRO:** (pauses, then sighs deeply) “Fine. But if this kills me, I’m haunting you.”  

**[SHINJIRO reluctantly takes a bite. His face immediately contorts into a mix of horror and confusion. The grinding noise in the background intensifies.]**  

**SHINJIRO:** (choking slightly) “What... is this? It tastes like... despair and regret.”  
**FUUKA:** (beaming) “That’s the Shadow Essence! I told you it would work!”  
**SHINJIRO:** (slamming the fork down) “Fuuka, I’m pretty sure this is just Tartarus floor dust. I can feel my HP draining.”  
**FUUKA:** (tilting her head) “Oh no! Maybe I should’ve used more healing items...”  
**SHINJIRO:** (groaning) “Healing items? Fuuka, this isn’t a dungeon crawl. It’s dinner.”  

**[The cauldron suddenly erupts, sending green goo everywhere. SHINJIRO narrowly dodges, but FUUKA gets hit square in the face. She stands there, covered in goo, looking like a defeated Shadow.]**  

**FUUKA:** (muttering) “I just wanted to make something nice...”  
**SHINJIRO:** (sighing, then pulling out a towel) “Here. Clean yourself up. Next time, stick to instant ramen.”  
**FUUKA:** (sniffling) “But instant ramen doesn’t have Shadow Essence...”  
**SHINJIRO:** (patting her head awkwardly) “Exactly.”  

**[The grinding noise fades as the scene ends, leaving only the faint sound of the cauldron bubbling ominously in the background.
