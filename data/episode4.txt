[KEN PLAYING GENSHIN]
[AKIHIKO WALKS IN]
AKIHIKO: Hey Ken
KEN: Hey Akihiko Senpai, welcome back, wait why are you covered in blood and sweat, where did you even come from!
AKIHIKO: Yea I just came back from beating up the homeless guy outside the dorm, these crack heads sure know how to fight when you take their meth off them. He almost got me with his shit covered knife, but I was able to give him a nice haymaker to the face!
KEN: Holy shit... is he dead?
AKIHIKO: Well he did fall head first on the concrete pavement and I heard his skull cave in on itself, but im sure he'll be just fine!
KEN: Akihiko senpai you cant just go around killing homeless people!
AKIHIKO: It was self defence! He was the one that asked me for money first! and besides, it makes for some great training!
KEN: How is that a justified reason to go Mike Tyson mode on a crack head! And what the hell is this training for, the next time another meth addict asks you for money?
AKIHIKO: Look Ken, if you dont stop getting on my ass for cleaning up the streets of these drug addicts, Ill take that Playstation 2 you're playing on right now and sonic punch it into a million pieces
KEN: You fucking boomer! its a PS5! whatever, i dont care anymore im just gonna keep playing genshin.
AKIHIKO: Genshin? Actually, i've been meaning to say, what the hell is this game?! all you've been doing is running around picking up flowers and shit ever since i came in. This looks boring as fuck! Where the hell is the fighting?
KEN: Akihiko you meat head, this is the exploration part of the game, i'm gathering materials to upgrade my characters
AKIHIKO: Huh, ok i see..., well i guess kids these days dont appreciate games like battlefield 3 or slenderman anymore...
KEN: Oh actually i've played those games!
AKIHIKO: Really? nevermind you're alot more cultured than I orginally thought!
KEN: Yea, those are the best games on roblox!
AKIHIKO: wait what roblox?
JUNPEI: Oh shit Ken is that Genshin Impact! Man you even got the Raiden Shogun! That has to be the hottest anime girl to ever bless our green earth! I could fill 15 jars full of my baby batter just looking at her fat badonkas!
AKIHIKO: Jesus Junpei stop right there! How the hell can say that degeneracy to a kid!
KEN: Akihiko Senpai dont worry about me I've heard worst stuff online then what junpei just said
AKIHIKO: Wow... unfiltered internet access for kids is truly the downfall of society...
SHINJIRO: Ken is that GenShit CringePact! Turn that game off right now it's full of pedophiles!
KEN: All of you fucking shut up and let me play my game! Stop treating me like im a special needs kid! Im not retarded Shinji Senpai, i know not to tell anyone my real name, age or location online
SHINJIRO: Sorry Ken, but im still concerned about the reputation this game has with people who are attracted to minors. I mean look at that character you're playing as right now! Thats a fucking 5 year old kid with no shoes!
KEN: Shes a 500 year old god so shes actually very legal, and im a kid too!
SHINJIRO: If i heard anyone else say that above the age of 15 I would be seriously concerned
JUNPEI: Shinji senpai stop being a dick! The game is full of big booty hot mommies anyways, that enough makes up for all the sexualised young kids!
AKIHIKO: What the fuck im i even hearing right now... what happened to the times where the only thing sexualised in games was half naked men with huge, strong muscles in tight spandex wrestling each other, covered in sweat and chest hair
JUNPEI: That is the gayest fucking shit i've ever heard in my life dude!
[TRANSITION]
KEN: Oh someone wants to join my world!
SHINJIRO: Don't accept that invite! it must be one of those kid touchers!
JUNPEI: Na ken! accept that shit! IT could be a sexy e girl!
KEN: Ok i accepted it!
[CHARACTER INTERACTION: Hiiiiiii]
[CHARACTER INTERACTION: emote]
[CHARACTER INTERACTION: f 17, you?]
KEN: well apparently they're a girl aged 17
AKIHIKO: who the hell says says their age and gender in an anime gacha game
SHINJIRO: That is such cap, there's no way its an actual girl our age right now
JUNPEI: You never know senpai! I think it's time to rizz up some genshin e girls! Hey respond back to her!
[CHARACTER INTERACTION: 11 M]
SHINJIRO: Ken why the fuck did you say your actual age?
KEN: People on the internet lie all the time, there's no way they'll belive me anyway
[CHARACTER INTERACTION: oooooo 11?]
[CHARACTER INTERACTION: sexy emote]
[CHARACTER INTERACTION: Are your parents home <3]
[CHARACTER INTERACTION: do you know what sex is?]
SHINJIRO: Jesus christ on a cross being stabbed by the romans, that is a pedophile alright! I told you everyone that plays this game is a predator, this is the most fucked up thing i've seen said to a kid, please block this scumbag right now
JUNPEI: Hold on dude! Just keep talking to her I wanna see where this goes! How can you cock block ken like this! If i was him i would wanna tap that 17 year old cheeks, man were where all the pedos when i was a kid!
AKIHIKO: Look Shinji, Ken should keep talking to her, but not for the reason junpei said becuase that is disgusting, but if we are able to arrange Ken to meet with them, we can jump out and beat them to death with our fists, we can rid the world of one less child molester
SHINJIRO: You two are unhinged for the exact opposite reasons holy shit, but Im with akihiko here lets fuck up some kids fiddlers
KEN: Fuck you guys! Im not doing any of that shit! I dont want to meet up with a pedophile! Thats just asking to get kidnapped in the back of a van and thrown into a basement for the rest of my life as a sex slave!
AKIHIKO: Ken listen to us! theres 3 of us and one of them, i'm pretty sure we can handle them whoever they are.
KEN: Ok i'll do it.. but you guys owe me some robux after i do this
JUNPEI: yea yea we'll use mitsurus credit card or something.
AKIHIKO: Ok ken, say to them to meet up for some cupcakes you baked
KEN: weirdly specific but ok
[CHARACTER INTERACTION: cupcakes?]
[CHARACTER INTERACTION: Yea lets meet up!]
[CHARACTER INTERACTION: You live in Tatsumi Port Island so, meet me at the Naganaki Shrine <3]
KEN: how the fuck did they know where we live
KEN: ok this is fucked
JUNPEI: Holy shitting fucking balls man im bugging out, i knew i shouldnt of popped that gas station edible earlier
AKIHIKO: Everyone calm down!... This must be the work of an enemy shadow! Even more reason to go and perform our duties as members of the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad, which is to brutally eradicate any shadows that oppose us!
[TRANSITION TO NAGANAKI SHRINE]
KEN: Ok i think i see them
SHINJIRO: Well thats a girl alright, dosent look like a shadow to me
JUNPEI: Nice one Ken, looks like you're losing your virignity today young man!
AKIHIKO: NO JUNPEI! This is clearly an illusion set up by the shadow, we are gonna beat the shit out of this child predator!
AKIHIKO: I dont discriminate based on gender! I'm all for equal rights, equal fights!
SHINJIRO: You two shut up she's gonna hear us!
KEN: I dont want to do this! I didnt think she would actually show up! I wanna go back to the dorm!
AKIHIKO: KEN YOU ARE STAYING HERE! We need you as bait! we can land some critical hits after you charm her!
JUNPEI: Aw come on! cant let a kid get some pussy before you guys do huh?
AKIHIKO: Ok its time Ken, go and distract her
