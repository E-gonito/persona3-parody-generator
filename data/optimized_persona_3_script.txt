[A blue butterfly appears for a few seconds before some text appears.]
Time never waits.
It delivers all equally to the same end.
You, who wish to safeguard the future,
however limited it may be...
You will be given one year;
go forth without falter,
with your heart as your guide...
[A young man is shown walking across town. Meanwhile, a young woman is sitting
in a bathroom with the sink water running. She lifts a gun to her forehead as
though to shoot herself, and hesitatingly puts her thumb on the trigger, but
drops the gun. The boy rides a train through town and gets off at the station
just as the clock reaches midnight. At midnight, the power on everything goes
out, the sky and the moon turn shades of green and everyone else turn into
coffins. Unfazed, the boy walks through town to the dorm he is looking for and
enters. A strange-looking boy appears inside and addresses the older boy.]
MYSTERIOUS BOY: You're late. I've been waiting a long time for you.
[The boy snaps. A red notebook suddenly appears on the desk.]
MYSTERIOUS BOY: Now if you want to proceed, please sign your name there. It's a
contract. Don't worry, all it says is that you'll accept full
responsibility for your actions. You know, the usual stuff.
[The player is prompted to enter a last and first name for the main character.]
MYSTERIOUS BOY: No one can escape time. It delivers us all to the same end. You
can't plug your ears and cover your eyes.
[The boy takes the contract and it disappears into thin air.]
MYSTERIOUS BOY: And so it begins.
[The boy disappears as well.]
FEMALE VOICE: Who's there?
[The girl from earlier enters the room and spots Main. She begins to go for her
gun.]
OLDER FEMALE VOICE: Takeba, wait!
[An older girl enters the room. As they stand around, the power goes back on
and everything seems to return to normal.]
[The older girl approaches Main.]
REDHEAD: I didn't think you'd arrive so late. My name is Mitsuru Kirijo. I'm
one of the students who live in this dorm.
BRUNETTE: ...Who's he?
MITSURU: He's a transfer student. It was a last minute decision to
assign him here. He'll eventually be moved to a room in the
boys' dorm.
BRUNETTE: ...Is it okay for him to be here?
MITSURU: I guess we'll see...  This is Yukari Takeba. She'll be
a junior this spring, just like you.
YUKARI TAKEBA: ...Hey.
MAIN: 
YUKARI TAKEBA: Uh, y-yeah... Nice to meet you too...
YUKARI TAKEBA: Huh? Um, well, it's sorta like a hobby... Well, not a
hobby, but...
MITSURU: You know how it is these days... It's for self-defense.
It's not a real gun, of course.
YUKARI TAKEBA: No, it's not, but... Umm, how should I explain it...?
MITSURU: Unlike the other buildings, this one's co-ed. It's not
your typical dorm, though. I'll explain it to you later
when I get a chance.
MITSURU: It's getting late, so you should get some rest. Your room is on
the second floor, at the end of the hallway. Your things should
already be there.
YUKARI TAKEBA: Oh... I'll show you the way. Follow me.
[Main and Yukari go to the second floor hallway. They walk to the room at the
end of the hall.]
YUKARI TAKEBA: This is it... Pretty easy to remember, huh? ...Since it's right
at the end of the hall. Oh yeah, make sure you don't lose your
key, or you'll never hear the end of it... So, any questions?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Huh? ...What contract?
YUKARI: What kid? What are you talking about? ...C'mon, it's not funny.
YUKARI: Um... Can I ask you something? On your way here from the station, was
everything okay?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: I see... Never mind, then.
YUKARI: You know what I-- ...Never mind. It seems like you're alright.
YUKARI: Well, I better get going...
[She starts to walk away, then stops.]
YUKARI: Um... I'm sure you still have other questions, but let's save them for
later, okay? Good night.
[Yukari leaves. Main enters his room.]

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main is standing in his room. There's a knock at the door.]
YUKARI: It's Yukari. Are you awake?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Hello! Please answer the door, or I'll get in trouble!
[Main opens the door and Yukari enters.]
YUKARI: Good morning. Did you sleep okay? Mitsuru-senpai asked me to take you
to school. It's getting late, so... Are you ready to go?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Okay. Then, let's go.
YUKARI: Oh, really? But, you don't wanna risk being late the first day,
do you? Just hurry up and get ready!
[Main and Yukari are riding the train to school.]
YUKARI: So, that's it. See? There it is.
[The school can be seen outside. Later, the pair are walking up the steps to
the school. They stop at the front gate.]
YUKARI: Well, this is it. We're here. Welcome to Gekkoukan High School. Hope
you like it.
[Inside, Main and Yukari are at the shoe lockers.]
YUKARI: You're okay from here, right? You should go see your homeroom teacher
first. The Faculty Office is right there to the left. ...And that
concludes the tour. Do you have any questions before I go?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Me? I dunno... I haven't looked at the classroom assignments
yet.
YUKARI: Hey... About last night... Don't tell anyone what you saw, okay? ...See
ya later.
[Yukari leaves.]
[Main enters the office hall and goes into the Faculty Office. A teacher inside
notices him.]
TEACHER: Oh, are you the new student?
[Main nods.]
TEACHER: ... 11th grade, correct? Wow, you've lived in
a lot of different places... Let's see... In 1999... That was what,
ten years ago? Your parents--  I'm sorry... I've been so busy,
I didn't have time to read this beforehand. I'm Ms. Toriumi. I teach
Composition. Welcome to ourschool.
MAIN: 
MS. TORIUMI: Wow, such enthusiasm!
MS. TORIUMI: Have you seen the classroom assignments? You're in 2-F; that's my
class. But first, we need to go to the auditorium. The Welcoming
Ceremony will be starting soon. Follow me.
[The scene changes to the auditorium. The Principal is at the podium on stage.]
PRINCIPAL: As you begin the new school year, I'd like each of you to remember
the proverb, "If a job's worth doing, it's worth doing well." When
applied to student life, this means...
[The focus changes to where Main is sitting.]
CLASSMATE: Psst... Hey...
CLASSMATE: You came to school with Yukari this morning, right? I saw you two
walking together. Hey, I have a question. Do you know if she has a
boyfriend?
MAIN: 
CLASSMATE: Man, I knew it... I mean, why wouldn't she? ...Wait, how
well do you know her?
CLASSMATE: Really? ...Oh, you asked her? Wow, I'm surprised... So, how
well do you know her?
CLASSMATE: I see. I thought you might know, but... I guess not. ...So,
how well do you know her?
TEACHER FROM ANOTHER CLASS: I hear talking. I believe it's someone in Ms.
Toriumi's class...
MS. TORIUMI: Shhh! Be quiet! You're going to get me in trouble!

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Scene changes to Main sitting in his homeroom. As he gets up to leave, another
student approaches him.]
STUDENT: S'up, dude? How's it goin'?
MAIN: 
STUDENT: Me?
STUDENT: Oh, come on. Let me introduce myself, at least.
STUDENT: I'm Junpei Iori. Nice to meet ya. I transferred here when I was in
eighth grade. I know how tough it is bein' the new kid... So I wanted
to say, "hey." ...See what a nice guy I am!
[Yukari enters and approaches Main and Junpei.]
JUNPEI: Hey, it's Yuka-tan! I didn't think we'd be in the same class again.
YUKARI: At it again, huh? I swear, you'll talk to anyone if they'll
listen. Did you ever think you might be bothering someone?
JUNPEI: What? But, I was just bein' friendly.
YUKARI: If you say so.  Anyway, looks like we're in the same
homeroom...
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Funny, huh?
YUKARI: I know, but still... I was a little surprised.
YUKARI: Fate? Yeah, right.  Still, I'm a little surprised.
JUNPEI: Um, hello? Are you forgetting that I'm in this class too? By the way, I
heard you two came to school together this morning. What's up with
that? C'mon, gimme the dirt!
YUKARI: Wh-What are you talking about!? We live in the same dorm. There's
nothing going on, okay? Why are people even talking about it!?
Now you have me worried...  Hey... You didn't say anything to
anyone about.. you know what, did you?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Okay, good.
YUKARI: Don't tell me you forgot already!
YUKARI: Seriously... Don't say anything about last night, alright?
JUNPEI: ...
YUKARI: Wh-What?
JUNPEI: L-Last night...?
YUKARI: W-Wait a minute! Don't get the wrong idea! Listen! I just met him
yesterday, and there's absolutely nothing between us! Geez... I've
gotta go. I've got something to take care of for the archery team.
But, you better not start any rumors!
[Yukari leaves.]
JUNPEI: Ah, who cares? No one takes rumors seriously, anyway. She's so
paranoid... But, hey! It's your first day here, and people are already
talkin' about you! Believe it or not, she's actually pretty popular.
You da man! Heheh, this is gonna be a fun year. I can feel it!

=== EVENING ===

[Scene changes to the dorm.]
HELP: YOU CAN SAVE YOUR GAME AT THE SIGN-IN SHEET.
MITSURU: Welcome back.
[Main goes to his room.]
[Later, Mitsuru is reading on the couch. Another student approaches her.]
Confident-looking Student: I'm going out for a bit.
MITSURU: ...Hm?
Confident-looking Student: Didn't you see the newspaper? There's a lot going
on.
MITSURU: ...I know. People who had no problems before are suddenly developing
acute cases of Apathy Syndrome... I've seen it in the news quite
often lately. They say it's due to stress, but...
Confident-looking Student: Yeah, right. It has to be THEM. Otherwise, it's not
worth my time...
MITSURU: You have a one-track mind... Will you be okay on your own? The
Chairman will be here for the next few days, but after that, I can...
Confident-looking Student: Don't worry. I'm just getting a little practice.
[The male student leaves.]
MITSURU: This isn't a game, Akihiko...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Did you hear the rumor...?
LISTENING STUDENT: Oh, um... something about... a bathroom?
GOSSIPING STUDENT: N-No! Not that one! I mean the one about the first-year
student! Not only did she stop coming to school, she does
nothing but sit and stare at the walls all day. If her
mother tries to talk to her, she only mutters to herself,
"It's coming... It's coming...!"
LISTENING STUDENT: Huh. How about that.
GOSSIPING STUDENT: You don't believe me...?
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== AFTERNOON ===

[Ms. Toriumi is teaching Composition.]
MS. TORIUMI: Hakushu Kitahara is great, but I think I prefer Fuyuhiko
Yoshimura. His works aren't as famous, but that's what I like
about him. My personal favorite is "Mangekyo." Why isn't it ever
in textbooks...? I'll bring it next time so you can write an essay
on it. ...Hey, Junpei! Were you listening? Who did I say was my
favorite author?
JUNPEI: H-Huh? U-Ummm...  Psst! Who does she like?
MAIN: 
MS. TORIUMI: Wrong! Why won't you pay attention to my lectures!? You'll
make me cry if you keep this up! Listen next time!
JUNPEI: U-Um, I-I... I'm sorry! You're gonna pay for this, Main...!
MS. TORIUMI: That's right! So you were listening to me after all!
JUNPEI: Eheheh... Well, you know how I like to pay attention! Man, you
saved my bacon, Main!
CLASSMATE: Main gave him the answer... He must pay attention in class!

=== EVENING ===

[Main returns to the dorm. Yukari is sitting down, talking to an older man in
the other chair.]
YUKARI: Oh, he's back.
SOPHISTICATED GENTLEMAN: So, this is our new guest...
[Yukari and the man stand up.]
SOPHISTICATED GENTLEMAN: Good evening. My name is Shuji Ikutsuki. I'm the
Chairman of the Board for your school. "Ikutsuki"...
Hard to say, isn't it? That's why I don't like
introducing myself. Even I get tongue-tied sometimes...
Please, have a seat.
[The three of them sit down.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I apologize about the confusion regarding your accomodations.
However, it may take a while longer before you receive a proper
room assignment. Is there anything you'd like to ask?
MAIN: 
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: To welcome you, of course. Well, to be honest, I do
have other business here. Speaking of which... where's
Mitsuru, Yukari?
YUKARI: She's upstairs.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: As diligent as always. Although, it doesn't hurt to
come down and say hello... Is there anything else?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: There are only four students in this dorm: you, Yukari
here, Mitsuru, and a senior named Akihiko Sanada. I
hope you all get along. Any other questions?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: You saw something strange? ...Like what?
YUKARI: ...
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: You were probably just tired. I wouldn't worry about
it.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Do you have another question?
SHUJI IKTSUKI: Then, I hope you have a successful school year. Now, if
you'll excuse me...
[Ikutsuki gets up.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: You must be tired from all the excitement. You should go to bed
early. As they say, "The early bird catches the bookworm!"
...Please forgive the bad pun.
[Ikutsuki leaves.]
YUKARI: ...You'll get used to his lame jokes.
[The scene ends and Main is shown asleep in his bed. The scene changes to show
Mitsuru, Yukari, and Ikutsuki, who are all standing in a control room of some
sort. Mitsuru and Yukari are sitting in front of the monitors.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Working hard? So, how's he doing?
[Mitsuru and Yukari stand up.]
MITSURU: He went to bed a little while ago. He's asleep now. Mr. Chairman, do
you think he's...?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Well, let's wait and see for now. ...The Dark Hour is
approaching.

=== DARK HOUR ===

[Several young people are shown sitting in an alleyway. One of them checks his
phone and stands up just as it turns to midnight. The sky turns green and
everyone else turn into coffins again. The student drops his phone and holds
his hands to his head. Black fluid seems to flow out of his head and he yells
before collapsing onto the ground.]
[The focus is back on Mitsuru, Yukari, and Ikutsuki.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Hmm... He's still sleeping. The Dark Hour occurs every day at
12 midnight; you could say it's the "hidden" hour. During this
time, an ordinary person Transmogrifies into a coffin, and is
oblivious to all that occurs.
YUKARI: Then, he must be...
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: As you can see, he's retained his human form. He's asleep, but
he's definately experiencing the Dark Hour. The only question
that remains is whether or not he has the potential. Although,
he must. ...If he didn't, they would've preyed on him by now.
YUKARI: Scary...
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: In any case, we should continue to monitor him for a few more
days.
MITSURU: Yes, Sir.
YUKARI: I feel kinda bad, though, spying on him like this...
[The camera zooms in on a mysterious door, which opens to reveal a huge room
covered in blue. The back wall is chain-link, displaying that the room seems
to be moving upward like an elevator, and has a large clock whose hands are
constinuously spinning. Main is seatted in a chair, and across the table from
him are a plain-looking woman and an old man with a long nose.]
MAN WITH A LONG NOSE: Welcome to the Velvet Room, my dear young man.
MAN WITH A LONG NOSE: My name is Igor. ...I am delighted to make your
acquaintance. This is Elizabeth. She's a resident here,
like myself.
ELIZABETH: Pleased to meet you.
IGOR: This place exists between dream and reality, mind and matter... It's been
years since we've had a guest.
[Igor waves his hand and the red notebook from the opening movie appears on the
table.]
IGOR: Only those who have signed the contract can enter this place...
Henceforth, you shall be welcome here in the Velvet Room. You are
destined to hone your unique ability, and you will require my help to do
so. I only ask one thing in return... that you abide by the contract,
and assume responsibility for the choices that you make.
MAIN: 
IGOR: ...That is fine, for now.
IGOR: Precisely... You are fast asleep in the real world as we speak.
This visit of yours is merely a dream. However, you will come
here of your own accord, sooner or later.
IGOR: Hold on to this...
IGOR: 'Til we meet again...
[The scene fades out.]

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main is standing in his room.]
[Later, Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Junpei there.]
JUNPEI: What's up!? Man, today is the perfect day! The sky is blue... We're
young... What more could we ask for!?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Of course! Dude, listen to this... Oh, wait! I'm not supposed
to say anything! Sorry, man.
JUNPEI: Dude, I'm not sick! Forget the ol' Junpei...! This is the REAL
me! You should cheer up, too. After all, you've got ME as a
friend.
[Main and Junpei enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Ekoda is teaching Classic Literature.]
MR. EKODA: Ahem... I'm Mr. Ekoda. I'll be teaching you Classic Literature. I'll
be teaching you about good old Japan all year. Some people say
Classic Lit isn't relevant to everyday life, but oh, how they're
wrong! Hey... Are you all listening to me?
MAIN: 
MR. EKODA: Let's begin. Open your textbooks, class. First on our
syllabus is "Ise Monogatari," the origin of Japanese
literature. It's a very interesting story. You youngsters
might call it, "da bomb." Anyway...
increased.
[Doze off]
[Main puts his head down.]
eyes... You start to feel better... Your condition is
now "Great"!

=== DARK HOUR ===

[Main is asleep in his bed. Mitsuru, Yukari, and Ikutsuki are in the control
room again.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: ...How is he?
MITSURU: ...The same as last night.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Hmm... Very interesting. Even those who have the potential
tend to be unstable at first... Memory loss... disorientation...
But, this subject is rather unique. He hasn't exhibited any of
the common symptoms.
YUKARI: But... we're treating him like a guinea pig.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I understand your concern, but it's imperative that we recruit
new members. I heard he's your classmate... Wouldn't you be
more comfortable working with someone from the same grade?
YUKARI: Yeah, I guess. But, still...
[There is a beep on the panal.]
MITSURU: Command room. ...Is that you, Akihiko?
AKIHIKO: You're not gonna believe this...! This thing
is huge! Unfortunately, I don't have time to talk... It's
chasing me... I wanted to let you guys know. I'm almost there.
YUKARI: Does that mean... he's bringing that thing here!?
MITSURU: Mr. Chairman! Let's suspend our observation for now. We'll prepare for
battle!
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: ...R-Right! Be careful!
[Scene changes to the front door. Akihiko enters and slumps down. Mitsuru,
Yukari, and Ikutsuki arrive from the control room.]
MITSURU: Akihiko!
AKIHIKO: Agh...!
YUKARI: Senpai!?
AKIHIKO: I'm alright. Get ready to be surprised... It'll be here any second.
MITSURU: This is no time to joke around!
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: It's one of them, Akihiko?
AKIHIKO: Yes, but not an ordinary one--
[The ground suddenly shakes.]
YUKARI: Ahh!! What the...!? ...You've gotta be kidding me!
[Mitsuru pulls out a gun.]
MITSURU: Mr. Chairman, please head for the command room! Takeba, go upstairs
and wake him up! Then, escape out the back.
YUKARI: But, what about you two?
MITSURU: We'll stop it here. You led it to us, Akihiko, so I'm afraid you'll
have to fight.
AKIHIKO: Like I had a choice! What are you waiting for, Yukari? Go!
YUKARI: I-I'm going!
[Scene changes to Main's room.]
decide to go take a look.
[Main has just gotten out of bed. Yukari knocks on the door.]
YUKARI: Wake up!! Sorry, I'm coming in!
[Yukari unlocks the door and enters.]
YUKARI: I don't have time to explain. We have to get out of here, now!
MAIN: 
[The ground shakes again.]
YUKARI: Hurry! Downstairs! We'll leave through the back door!
YUKARI: Wait! ...Take this, just in case.
YUKARI: ...Okay, let's go!
[Main and Yukari run downstairs to the back door.]
YUKARI: Alright, we should be safe now--
MITSURU: Takeba, do you read me!?
YUKARI: Y-Yes! I hear you!
MITSURU: Be careful! There's more than one enemy! The one
we're fighting isn't the one Akihiko saw!
YUKARI: What!?
[There are several loud knocks on the back door.]
YUKARI: L-Let's pull back!
[Main and Yukari move towards the stairs.]
YUKARI: What are we going to do...? They're downstairs! Do we have any choice
but to go further up?
[Main and Yukari move to the second floor.]
YUKARI: W-Whoa, whoa! What are we going to do!?
[Main and Yukari keep going up to the fourth floor. The ground shakes again and
they hear the sound of something breaking.]
YUKARI: What was that!?
[The ground continues to shake.]
YUKARI: It's getting closer! K-Keep moving! Hurry!!
[Main and Yukari continue to the fifth floor.]
YUKARI: O-Oh yeah! If we go out through here--!
[Main and Yukari leave through the rooftop exit, and Yukari locks the door
behind her.]
YUKARI: I think we're okay for now...
[The ground shakes again.]
YUKARI: ...!?
[Main and Yukari turn around. A large, multi-limbed creature holding a mask
climbs onto the roof. It spots them, and pulls out a few blades and moves to
attack them.]
YUKARI: Those monsters... We call them Shadows!
[Yukari takes out the gun she had earlier, puts the gun to her head and pulls
the trigger. Several energy columns begin to spring up. However, the Shadow
strikes the gun with one of its blades and she drops it as she falls to the
ground. The gun lands at Main's feet. A vision of the young boy from the
opening appears.]
MYSTERIOUS BOY: Go on...
[Akihiko, Mitsuru, and Ikutsuki are back in the control room and they spot Main
and Yukari on the monitors.]
AKIHIKO: There!
[Akihiko and Mitsuru begin to leave.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Wait.
[Main picks up the gun, recalls what Yukari did with it, and lifts it to his
temple. He hesitates at first, but then calms down and pulls the trigger.]
MAIN: Persona.
[Beads of energy start to stream around Main, and an odd looking being appears
above him. Mitsuru, Akihiko, and Ikutsuki look on from the monitors.]
ORPHEUS: Thou art I, and I am thou. From the sea of thy soul I cometh. I am
Orpheus, master of strings...
MITSURU: As we suspected...
[Suddenly Orpheus begins to convulse, until he is ripped apart from the inside
as a larger Persona bursts from within him. The huge new Persona lunges at the
Shadow, and cuts its mask in half with a swipe of its blade. As the Shadow
begins to split apart, the Persona grabs a tendril of it and squeezes it into
nothingness. It then floats into the air and reverts back to Orpheus.]
[Mitsuru, Akihiko, and Ikutsuki are still in the control room.]
MITSURU: ...!!
AKIHIKO: What on earth is that!?
IKUTSUKI: ......
[The scene changes back to the roof. Orpheus is floating in the air above
Main.]
You have obtained a new Persona!
[Orpheus disappears.]
YUKARI: Is it over...? ...!
[Several small shadows creep over to Main, and he manages to defeat them, but
then collapses. Yukari runs over to him.]
YUKARI: Are you okay!? Come on...! Say something!
[Mitsuru and Akihiko arrive.]
AKIHIKO: Are you alright!?
YUKARI: Can you hear me!? Please...! Answer me!
[The cutscene where Main enters the door to the Velvet Room replays.]
IGOR: It's so nice to see you again. You became unconscious after awakening to
your "power." ...It's nothing to worry about, though. So, just relax. By
the way... I see that it was Orpheus that heeded your calling. That power
is called a Persona... It is a manifestation of your psyche.
MAIN: 
IGOR: It may take some time to fully comprehend. A Persona is a facet of your
personality that surfaces as you react to external stimuli... You can
think of it as a mask that protects you as you brave many hardships. That
being said, your power is still weak...
MAIN: 
IGOR: When you use your Persona ability, you must channel your inner strength.
The ability evolves as you develop your Social Links--your emotional ties
with others. The stronger your Social Links, the more powerful your
Persona ability. Please remember that. Now, then... Time marches on in
your world. I shouldn't keep you here any longer. Next time we meet, you
will come here of your own accord. Until then... Farewell.
[The scene fades out.]

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

You feel someone's presence beside you.
[Main wakes up in a hospital bed. Yukari is sitting next to the bed.]
YUKARI: You're awake...! Um, how do you feel?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Thank goodness. You finally came to...  How much sleep do you
need!? It's been a whole week! ...I was so worried about you...
YUKARI: ...Oh yeah, this is Tatsumi Memorial Hospital. It's just a
short walk from the station.
YUKARI: You saved my life, you know... so I couldn't just leave you
here.
YUKARI: The doctor couldn't find anything wrong with you. He said you were
just exhausted... But, you kept sleeping and sleeping. You know how
worried I was? Um... I'm sorry I couldn't do anything... Even though I
was supposed to protect you, I... But, your power... It was amazing.
MAIN: 
YUKARI: You mean the Shadows? They're what we're fighting against. And
the power you used... We call it "Persona."
YUKARI: The power you used... We call it "Persona." And those creatures
you defeated are Shadows--our enemy.
YUKARI: We'll explain everything later. I'm sorry I didn't tell you before...
I, uh... I wanted to tell you that... I'm sorta like you.
MAIN: 
YUKARI: My dad died in an accident when I was little... And my mom and I aren't
exactly on good terms... You're all alone too, right? To be honest, I
already know about your past... But, it didn't seem fair, so I wanted
you to know about mine... It was back in '99... There was a big
explosion in the area. Supposedly, my dad died in the blast, but nobody
really knows what happened... He was working in a lab run by the Kirijo
Group. So, I'm hoping that if I stick around long enough, I'll find out
something. That's why I'm going to Gekkoukan High, and why I was there
when this happened to you. ...Of course, I panicked and wasn't much
help... It was my first time fighting them, too. I'm sorry... You
wouldn't have to go through all thisif I wasn't such a coward...
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Thanks... but still...
YUKARI: Really...? But still...
YUKARI: And here I am telling you all this the minute you wake up. While I was
waiting, I thought to myself, "I've been hiding so many things from
him... As soon as he wakes up, I'll tell him the truth." So, thanks for
listening. I've been wanting to share that story with someone for a
long time. ...Alright, I'm gonna get going. I'll let the others know
you woke up. Take it easy, okay? Be a good patient! And don't hesitate
to call the nurse. I'm sure she'll take good care of you.
[Yukari begins to leave.]
YUKARI: ...Bye.
[She leaves.]

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Yukari there.]
YUKARI: Mornin'. You seem to be doin' pretty well.
MAIN: 
YUKARI: That's good.
YUKARI: Wow, even after all that rest... Is it difficult to walk?
YUKARI: Hey, sorry to add this to your worries, but... Ikutsuki-san wants to
talk to you today. Come to the 4th floor of the dorm after school,
okay? Don't forget.
[Main and Yukari enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Ono is teaching Japanese History.]
MR. ONO: So, the Stone Age can be summarized as mankind's struggle against the
mammoths. Aaaaand that's enough about the Stone Age. I'm sick of it.
I'd rather talk about the Sengoku era! Japanese history's not that
exciting until then. Though I'm paid to do this, so I've gotta... It's
tough being an adult. Okay, can anyone answer a question about the
Stone Age? Hmm... Junpei, how about you? The Stone Age is divided into
the Paleolithic and the Neolithic eras. What's the difference between
them?
JUNPEI: Uhh... How am I supposed to know about something way back then? Tell
me, Main! What's the answer?
MAIN: 
MR. ONO: Corrrect. Paleolithic tools were chipped stone, while
Neolithic tools were ground stone. Though either way, they
used stone tools. Ugh... I wanna get to the age of katanas.
Everything else is so dull...
JUNPEI: Hey...! I answered right, and I don't get any credit? Tch...
Oh well. Thanks, Main.
CLASSMATE: Main told Junpei the answer. He's really smart!
MR. ONO: No... I guess you guys care even less about the Stone Age than
I do. Well, it'll all be fine once we hit the age of katanas...
JUNPEI: Whoa, that's all I get for the wrong answer? He really doesn't
care...

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

the dorm...

=== EVENING ===

[Main returns to the dorm.]
[Main goes up to the fourth floor. Yukari is waiting there for him.]
YUKARI: Oh! There you are!
[Main and Yukari enter the control room. Mitsuru, Akihiko, and Ikutsuki are
already seated inside. There's a briefcase on the table.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Ah, there you are. I'm glad that you're okay. The reason I
asked you here is because I needed to talk to you. Please, have
a seat.
[Main and Yukari sit down.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Oh, before that. I believe I mentioned him earlier, but this is
Akihiko.
AKIHIKO: How ya doin'?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Okay, let me start off by asking you this... Would you believe
me if I said that a day consists of more than 24 hours?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: I'm not surprised by your reaction. However, you've
already experienced this truth firsthand.
MITSURU: Do you remember the night you came here? You had to have noticed the
signs... The streetlights went out... Nothing was working... There
were coffins everywhere... Didn't it feel like you were in a different
time...? That's the Dark Hour--a time period hidden between one day
and the next.
MAIN: 
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I guess it's more like something people aren't aware
of. But, the Dark Hour does exist. It occurs each
night, at midnight.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: It occurs each night, as the clock strikes twelve.
SHUJI IKUTSUJI: I know how you feel. Who would believe such a story?
But, the Dark Hour occurs each night, right at
midnight.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: It'll happen tonight, and every night to come.
AKIHIKO: Normal people don't realize it, since they're all sleeping inside
their coffins. But, that's not what makes the Dark Hour so
interesting. ...You saw those creatures. We call them "Shadows." They
only appear during the Dark Hour, and attack anyone not in a coffin.
It's our job to defeat them. ...Sounds exciting, huh?
MITSURU: Akihiko! Why are you always like that? You just got hurt the other
day!
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Now, now. He does his work well.  Long story short,
we're the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad--SEES for
short. On paper, we're classified as a school club. But in
reality, this group is dedicated to defeating the Shadows.
Mitsuru is the leader. I'm the club advisor.
MITSURU: A Shadow feeds on the mind of its prey; the victim becomes a living
corpse. They're responsible for most of the incidents on the news, if
not all of them.
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Unfortunately, the police can't do anything during the Dark
Hour...
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Although rare, there are those who can function during the
Dark Hour. Some may even awaken to a power that enables them to
fight the Shadows. That's "Persona"--the power you used the
other night. The Shadows can only be defeated by Persona-users.
Which means, it's all up to you guys.
MAIN: 
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I'm glad you're quick to understand.
[Mitsuru gets up and opens the briefcase on the table. Inside is a gun like
the one Yukari had.]
MITSURU: What he's trying to say is, we want you to join us. We've prepared an
Evoker for you. We'd like you to lend us your strength.
MAIN: 
YUKARI: I was afraid you'd say no... Welcome aboard!
AKIHIKO: Don't think too much. Just hang out with us for a while.
MITSURU: Please, we need your help.
YUKARI: Wait, you can't ask him like that! Who could say no...? I mean,
it'd be nice if he joined, but...
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Thank you. If you have any questions, feel free to
ask.
YUKARI: Does that mean you accept?  I was afraid you'd
say no... I feel much better now.
MITSURU: I really appreciate it. If you have any questions,
feel free to ask.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Thank you so much. I'm really glad. Oh, I almost forgot...
About your room assignment... Why don't you just stay here, in
your current room? I don't know what the holdup is, but I guess
it worked out in the end.
YUKARI: Holdup? But, wasn't that-- Oh, never mind... It doesn't matter
anymore...
[The Fool Card appears.]
ARCANA: Thou shalt have our blessing when thou choosest to create a Persona of
the Fool Arcana...
growing... You recall what Igor said about the power of Social Links.

=== DARK HOUR ===

MYSTERIOUS BOY: Hi, how are you?
[Main is in his bed. The boy is sitting on the edge of the bed.]
MYSTERIOUS BOY: 
MAIN: 
MYSTERIOUS BOY: We've met before.
MYSTERIOUS BOY: I'm always with you...
MYSTERIOUS BOY: Soon, the end will come. I remembered, so I thought I should
tell you.
MAIN: 
MYSTERIOUS BOY: The end of everything. ...But to be honest, I don't
really know what it is.
MYSTERIOUS BOY: Really? ...If you say so. To be honest, I can't tell
you much about it yet.
MYSTERIOUS BOY: Oh, looks like you've awakened to your power...and an unusual
power it is. A power that takes many forms, yet is bound by
none... It may prove to be your salvation, depending on where
you end up.
[The boy disappears and reappears at the foot of the bed.]
MYSTERIOUS BOY: Do you remember when we first met? I expect you to honor your
commitment. I'll be watching you, even if you forget about
me... Okay then, see you later.
[He vanishes.]

=== EVENING ===

downstairs.
YUKARI: Hey, it's me. Can you come down here?
[Sometime later, Main, Yukari, and Akihiko are at the front door.]
YUKARI: ...Okay, he's here now. So, what's this all about?
AKIHIKO: There's someone I want to introduce.  ...Hey, hurry up.
VOICE FROM OUTSIDE: Hold your horses... This is freakin' heavy.
[The door opens and Junpei enters with some suitcases.]
YUKARI: J-Junpei!? ...Why is HE here!? Wait, don't tell me--
AKIHIKO: This is Junpei Iori from Class 2-F. He'll be staying here as of today.
JUNPEI: Wazzup?
YUKARI: He's staying HERE!? You've gotta be kidding me!
AKIHIKO: I bumped into him the other night. He has the potential, but he just
awakened to it recently... I told him about us, and he agreed to help.
YUKARI: You have the potential!? For real!?
JUNPEI: He found me cryin' like a baby at the convenience store, surrounded by
a bunch of coffins. I don't remember much, but... man, that's
embarrassing! He said that's, ya know, completely normal... in the
beginning. Like, bein' confused and not remembering anything. Did ya
guys know that?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Oh... that's good. You should, since you're a Persona-user.
JUNPEI: Didn't he tell ya? Man, every Persona-user should know THAT.
JUNPEI: Big deal. It happens to everyone else.
JUNPEI: ...But man, I was shocked to find out about you guys. I had no idea.
I'm glad I'm not the only one. It could get kinda lonely, ya know.
I bet you're stoked too, right!? Havin' me join...
YUKARI: Huh? Uh, y-yeah...
AKIHIKO: Well, enough with the introductions. I think we're about ready...
JUNPEI: Ooh, we're gonna go do something? Sweetness!
AKIHIKO: With this many people, we can start exploring that place.
YUKARI: You mean... Tartarus...?
JUNPEI: Tartarus...? What's that? ...Sounds like toothpaste.
AKIHIKO: We believe we can find the reason for the Dark Hour there.
YUKARI: I hope so...
AKIHIKO: The Chairman will give us the details tomorrow night, so be ready.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Good morning. I'm always so drowsy on Monday mornings...
LISTENING STUDENT: Yeah, me too. The only thing you can do is to sleep through
first period. Wait... tomorrow is when we have morning
assembly!
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Ughhh... I'm too lazy for that. I'll just pretend I didn't
hear...
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== LUNCHTIME ===

[Main and Junpei are talking to each other in their homeroom. Yukari stands
up.]
YUKARI: I thought I was gonna fall asleep in there...
[Mitsuru enters the room and walks over to the group.]
MITSURU: Can I have a minute? Come to the lounge when you get back to the dorm.
I have something to tell everyone.
JUNPEI: Oh, are we having that talk?
MITSURU: I'll save the details for later. See you there.
[Mitsuru leaves.]
JUNPEI: Wow, she didn't waste any time leaving...
YUKARI: She's probably busy with things like Student Council, unlike us.
JUNPEI: Whoa, Yuka-tan! Do I sense some hostility?
YUKARI: Well, it's not that I don't like her... She's just...

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

today.

=== EVENING ===

[Main returns to the dorm. Everyone meets in the room on the fourth floor.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Okay, everybody's here. I'd like your undivided attention. For
a long time, Mitsuru and Akihiko were the only Persona-users we
had. But, that number recently jumped to five. Therefore...
Starting tonight at 12:00AM, I'd like to commence the
exploration of Tartarus.
JUNPEI: Sorry... I asked this yesterday, but what's this Tartarus thing again?
YUKARI: You haven't seen it, Junpei?
JUNPEI: Hm...?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: It's no surprise...since it only appears during the Dark Hour.
JUNPEI: The Dark Hour...?
AKIHIKO: Just like the Shadows... Interesting, huh? And it's the perfect place
for us to train. You can think of it as a Shadow nest.
JUNPEI: Whoa... Their nest, huh...?
YUKARI: But, Senpai... what about your injury?
MITSURU: Since Akihiko hasn't fully recovered yet, he'll only come as far as
the entrance.
AKIHIKO: ...Yeah, I know.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Well, I'm sure he won't complain, as long as you don't go too
far in. Since we're dealing with Shadows, Tartarus isn't
something we can avoid.
JUNPEI: Relax, I've got your backs.
YUKARI: I'm not so sure about this...
MITSURU: What about you, Mr. Chairman?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I'll stay here. As you know, I can't summon a Persona...

=== LATE NIGHT ===

[The scene changes to the school gate, where all the students have gathered.]
JUNPEI: This is is? THIS is the place? Why HERE?
AKIHIKO: Just wait a few minutes... It's almost midnight.
[Akihiko's watch reaches midnight and the Dark Hour arrives. A huge,
impossibly-constructed tower arises from the school grounds and stretches up
towards the sky.]

=== DARK HOUR ===

MITSURU: This is Tartarus--the labyrinth that reveals itself during the Dark
Hour.
JUNPEI: Labyrinth...? What are you talking about!? What happened to our
school!?
MITSURU: Once the Dark Hour passes, everything returns to normal.
JUNPEI: This is the "nest" you were talking about!? But, why!?
Why'd our school turn into a giant tower!?
MITSURU: ......
JUNPEI: You don't know, either?
MITSURU: ...No.
YUKARI: I'm sure it's complicated. Who cares anyway? It's not like it would
change our minds about fighting.
AKIHIKO: Well, maybe now we'll find out. Mitsuru and I have only gone in to
take a peek; this will be our first time exploring it. Exciting, isn't
it? There has to be some sort of clue in here about the Dark Hour...
MITSURU: Akihiko. I respect your enthusiasm, but you won't be accompanying us
today.
AKIHIKO: I know... You don't have to remind me.
[Everyone enters Tartarus to find a large staircase leading up.]
JUNPEI: Whoa... It's just as cool on the inside...
YUKARI: But, it sure is creepy...
MITSURU: This is only the entrance. The labyrinth lies beyond the doorway at
the top of the stairs.
AKIHIKO: First, we'll have you three get a feel for this place. Why don't you
go have a look around?
YUKARI: What!? By ourselves!?
MITSURU: We're not asking you to go very far, and I'll be feeding you
information from here.
JUNPEI: So, you two didn't plan on coming in the first place?
AKIHIKO: That's right. We're also going to appoint a leader to make any
necessary decisions.
JUNPEI: For real? ...One of us? Oh! Oh! Me me me! Pick me!
AKIHIKO: ...You're in charge.
JUNPEI: W-Wait! Why him!? He doesn't look like a leader!
YUKARI: But, he HAS fought them before...
JUNPEI: Seriously?
AKIHIKO: That's true, but there's another reason. You two...
[Yukari and Junpei face Akihiko. He pulls out his Evoker and puts it to his
head.]
AKIHIKO: Can you summon your Persona without any difficulties, like he can?
JUNPEI: Y-Yeah, of course I can!
YUKARI: I think so.
[Akihiko brings the Evoker back down to his side.]
AKIHIKO: These are Shadows we're talking about here. Without your Persona,
you're screwed.
YUKARI: I'm aware of that.
[EVeryone moves towards the stairs, but Main hears a sound and stops to look
to his left.]
[A freestanding doorway is off to the side. Main walks over to it.]
[The door opens, and Main appears in the Velvet Room. He stands in front of the
chair.]
IGOR: I've been waiting for you. The time has come for you to wield your power.
The tower that you are about to venture into... How did it come to be?
For what purpose does it exist? Regrettably, you are not yet capable of
answering these questions. That is why you must be made aware of the
nature of your power.
MAIN: 
IGOR: It leads here, although no one but you can see it.
IGOR: Please, you must understand... It is of the utmost importance.
Besides, this shall be the last time I beckon you here...
IGOR: Your power is unique. It's like the number zero... It's empty, but at the
same time holds infinite possibilities. You, my boy, are able to possess
multiple Personas, and summon them as needed. And when you have defeated
your enemies, you will see the faces of possibility before you. There may
be times when they are difficult to grasp... But, do not fear. Seize what
you have earned. Your power will grow accordingly... Be sure to keep that
in mind. My spare time will soon be scarce. But, please come again of
your own accord. I'll tell you then about my true role... the manner in
which I can best assist you. Until then... Farewell.
[Main returns to the lobby in Tartarus, in front of the door he entered. Yukari
and Junpei walk over to him.]
YUKARI: Hey, are you alright?
JUNPEI: Yeah, what's up? You look like a zombie.
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Don't tell me you just dozed off! You're like that coach who
fell asleep during the championship game! Come on, man. You're
s'posed to be our leader.
YUKARI: Cut him some slack. If nothing's wrong, then let's get going.
YUKARI: Huh? What door...?
JUNPEI: Man, are you loco?
YUKARI: Have you been nodding off? You seem kinda out of it.
JUNPEI: Dude, you're s'posed to be our leader. Get your head in the
game!
YUKARI: Come on, let's go.
HELP: YOU CAN CHECK YOUR OWN STATUS BY PRESSING THE TRIANGLE BUTTON. ALSO, YOU
CAN SAVE YOUR PROGRESS BY ACCESSING THE CLOCK TO THE LEFT OF THE
ENTRANCE.
[Main, Yukari, and Junpei enter the door at the top of the stairs.]
JUNPEI: So, this is it, huh...?
YUKARI: I hope I don't get lost...
MITSURU: Can you all hear me?
JUNPEI: Whoa! Is that you, Senpai?
MITSURU: I'll be providing audio backup from here on out.
JUNPEI: Wait... Ya mean, you can see inside here?
MITSURU: It's my Persona's ability. I'd like to join you, but
the structure of Tartarus changes from day to day. That's why outside
support is imperative.
YUKARI: Well, THAT makes me feel a whole lot better...
MITSURU: Now, based on your current location, you can expect
to encounter enemies at any minute. They shouldn't be too tough, but
proceed with caution. Practice makes perfect.
JUNPEI: Right!
YUKARI: Got it.  Why is she always like that...?
MITSURU: Let's begin. Keep in mind, these are real battles
you'll be engaging in. Now, see if you can eliminate all the Shadows
wandering around on this floor.
[The party moves forward. They spot a Shadow a bit further in.]
MITSURU: Watch out! I detect a Shadow in front of you! Move
in and hit it before it attacks you!
HELP: PRESS THE X BUTTON TO USE YOUR WEAPON. IF YOU CAN HIT AN ENEMY BEFORE IT
HITS YOU, THEN YOU'LL HAVE THE ADVANTAGE AT THE START OF BATTLE.
[Main runs up and strikes the enemy, which begins a battle.]
MITSURU: Takeba has informed me about your power, but
nevertheless you have minimal combat experience. Would you like me to
explain the basics of battle?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: The primary offensive abilities available to
you in battle are "Attack" and "Skill." "Attack" corresponds
to the weapon you have equipped, while "Skill" relates to your
Persona's abilities. Though skills consume either stamina or
spiritual power, they tend to have a greater effect. Use
whichever option best suits the situation. Keep attacking
until you've defeated the enemy, but pay careful attention to
your stamina. That's it for now. Did you get all that?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Okay, then I want you to defeat the enemy before you.
Try using both the "Skill" and "Attack" options.
[The party defeats the Shadow and moves on. They notice a staircase in a
corner room.]
MITSURU: There should be a staircase nearby. Do you see it? A
staircase is the only way to proceed to the next floor. I can't allow
you to go any higher today, but please remember about it next time.
[The party continues on, and sees another Shadow.]
MITSURU: There's another Shadow ahead of you! You'll be at a
disadvantage if the enemy gets the first hit in, so try to surprise
your opponents and strike first.
HELP: IF YOU ARE ABLE TO STRIKE THE ENEMY BEFORE YOU ARE SPOTTED, THEN YOU WILL
GAIN THE INITIATIVE. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THE ENEMY HITS YOU FIRST, THE
OPPOSITE WILL OCCUR.
[Main strike the enemy and begins another battle.]
MITSURU: Now's a good time for me to explain about attack
properties, which are important to consider during battle. Do you want
to know more?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Nearly every type of attack is associated
with a particular property. For example, swords can be used to
do "Slash" attacks, while bows are used to do "Pierce"
attacks. Skills, on the other hand, have different properties.
"Bufu," for instance, indicates an "Ice" attack. Now, most
enemies are vulnerable to certain types of attacks. In other
words, they have weaknesses. A Fire skill will deal greater
damage to an enemy that's weak against Fire. With my power, I
can analyze an enemy to determine its weaknesses and
strengths. That falls under "Tactics."
HELP: THE FIRST TIME AN ENEMY IS ANALYZED, YOU MAY HAVE TO WAIT A WHILE
FOR THE RESULTS. BUT FROM THEN ON, WHENEVER YOU ANALYZE THAT
PARTICULAR ENEMY, YOU'LL RECEIVE THE RESULTS RIGHT AWAY. WHEN YOU
ARE SELECTING YOUR TARGET, IF A "?" APPEARS ABOVE THE ENEMY, THEN
THAT PARTICULAR ENEMY HAS NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY ANALYZED. YOU CAN
SELECT "ANALYZE" FROM THE TACTICS MENU OR PRESS THE L1 BUTTON TO
ISSUE THIS REQUEST.
MITSURU: Do you follow?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: The enemies you're facing have a weakness that you
can exploit. Why don't you give it a try?
[The party defeats the enemies. They continue on, reaching an intersection.]
MITSURU: There seems to be a Shadow just around the corner.
Approach carefully to avoid being spotted. The map will prove to be
quite useful as you explore, so use it often.
[The party rounds the corner and Main strikes the enemy to begin another
battle.]
MITSURU: Were you able to exploit the enemy's weakness in the
last battle? If you didn't already notice, doing so will also grant
you an additional attack. Would you like more details?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: An enemy will lose its balance if you exploit
its weakness or land a critical hit. This will give you the
opportunity to perform an additional action. In other words,
you'll get to do "1 MORE" thing. You can keep attacking the
same enemy, or if you'd prefer, attack a different target. And
if you succeed in knocking another enemy off balance, then you
can act yet again. Which means, you can remain on the
offensive for as long as you can keep this up. This strategy
is essential to securing victory. However, remember this: an
enemy that's already lost its balance cannot be knocked off
balance again. You can't knock down someone who's lying on the
ground, right? It's the same idea. Now, to knock an enemy off
balance, you need to know its weaknesses. So, don't hesitate
to ask me for an analysis. I'll be sure to share the results
with the others as well. Got it?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Then, proceed with the battle. Use what you've
learned to quickly dispose of the enemy.
[The party defeats the enemies. Suddenly the words "Shuffle Time" appear and
some cards are displayed.]
was talking about.
HELP: AFTER BATTLE, YOU WILL OCCASIONALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SELECT A CARD
FROM THE ONES SHUFFLED BEFORE YOUR EYES. IF YOU PICK A CARD WITH A
PERSONA ON IT, THEN YOU WILL RECEIVE THAT PERSONA. THERE ARE OTHER CARDS,
EACH OF WHICH HAS A UNIQUE EFFECT OR REWARD. KEEP AN EYE ON THE CARD YOU
WANT AND TRY TO PICK IT.
[The cards shuffle and Main selects one. The party then proceeds further. They
see another Shadow.]
MITSURU: I detect a Shadow up ahead... How are you feeling?
If you or another party member is in bad shape, then use healing items
prior to engaging the enemy. If you don't have anything on hand, then
ask Takeba to heal you. You should make a habit of checking your
status before entering into a battle.
HELP: IF YOU OR ANOTHER PARTY MEMBER HAS A PERSONA WITH HEALING SKILLS, BE
SURE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.
[Main strikes the Shadow to start yet another battle.]
MITSURU: There is a better way to defeat all of your enemies
in battle than to attack them individually... You can perform an
"All-Out Attack." Would you care to hear more about this?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: When enemies are thrown off balance, they
become vulnerable. An All-Out Attack will allow your entire
team to attack simultaneously. Your enemies will be unable to
defend against it; it's a very reliable method of attack.
Whether or not you want to perform an All-Out Attack is up to
you. But remember, you cannot perform it when you're alone.
So if you want to have it in your arsenal, make sure your team
comprises at least two members. That's all you need to know
about All-Out Attacks. Do you understand what I've just
explained to you?
MAIN: 
(Repeats All-Out Attack instructions, returns to questions
prompt.)
MITSURU: Then, that concludes the basics of battle. But,
there's one last thing I need to tell you... Shadows become stronger
the further you advance. If you don't think you can win a battle,
retreat at once. There may be times, however, when an escape will be
impossible. ...This battle is one of those times. Good luck.
[The party defeats the enemies and move ahead to another intersection.]
MITSURU: ...That's odd. Usually, there are more Shadows on
the prowl. ...Well, at least you gained some experience in battle.
Let's go back to the dorm for today. There should be an Access Point
somewhere on that floor. You can use it to return to the entrance.
Since there aren't any enemies to worry about, why don't you split up
and search individually? Just tell the other party members what you'd
like them to do.
HELP: PRESS THE SQUARE BUTTON TO ISSUE ORDERS TO YOUR ALLIES.
[The party decides to split up.]
HELP: USE THIS COMMAND TO INSTRUCT YOUR PARTY MEMBERS TO SPREAD OUT AND LOOK
FOR STAIRS, ACCESS POINTS, AND ITEMS. HOWEVER, IF THEY ARE NOT VERY
STRONG, THEY CAN EASILY FALL PREY TO THE ENEMY. BE SURE TO KEEP AN EYE
ON THEIR HP.
[One of the party members finds the Access Point. The party decides to return
to the first floor. They appear in front of the warp device, and walk over to
where Mitsuru and Akihiko are standing.]
MITSURU: Welcome back. So, how was it?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: I see. Well if you gained confidence, that's the best thing
you could have achieved.
MITSURU: Don't get discouraged. You completed your task, and that's
something to be proud of.
MITSURU: It must've hit you all at once. Don't worry, you'll get used
to it.
JUNPEI: Wow... I never knew I had that kind of power! We kicked some ass! But
damn, I'm beat...
YUKARI: That's cuz you were bouncin' around like a little kid.
JUNPEI: You look pretty tired yourself, Yuka-tan.
YUKARI: I'm still trying to catch my breath, actually...
MITSURU: That's the effect of the Dark Hour; you'll become fatigued more
easily. Don't worry, though, you'll adapt. But, I'm surprised... You
all did much better than I expected. At this rate, they'll catch up to
you in no time, Akihiko.
AKIHIKO: Heh, we'll see about that.
[The Fool Card appears.]
ARCANA: Thou art I... And I am thou... Thou shalt have our blessing when thou
choosest to make a Persona of the Fool Arcana...
the Fool Arcana has grown!
[Main heads for the exit.]
HELP: IT WILL BE THE NEXT DAY WHEN YOU STOP EXPLORING AND RETURN TO THE DORM.
[Main leaves Tartarus and the day ends.]

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He is greeted by another student.]
FRIENDLY STUDENT: Hey, you're Main, right?
MAIN: 
FRIENDLY STUDENT: Man, I knew it. I heard from Junpei that you're pretty close
with Yukari-san. ...What's up with that? Well, I guess it
doesn't matter. I'm looking for someone with a little more
experience anyway. By the way... I'm Kenji Tomochika. There's
a morning assembly, so we better hurry.
[Main and Kenji enter the school. The scene changes to the auditorium. Mitsuru
and another student are on stage; the student is at the podium.]
STUDENT: ...That concludes the main portion of today's assembly. Next, we'll
hear a word from the Student Council. Please welcome the new
President, Mitsuru Kirijo, from Class 3-D.
MITSURU: Thank you.
[The student steps aside and Mitsuru walks to the podium. Focus shifts to Main,
Yukari, and Junpei in the seats.]
YUKARI: So, she did get elected. Well... I guess she IS the most popular girl
in school.
JUNPEI: You can say that again! There's like some kinda aura around her...
Besides, this school's owned by the Kirijo Group, right?
YUKARI: Yeah, I try not to think about that.
[Focus shifts back to the stage.]
MITSURU: As I begin my term as Student Council President, I'd like to share
with you my vision for this coming year. It is my firm belief that
each of us must accept the responsibility of bettering our school.
However, change cannot occur without sustained effort and an
unprecedented level of commitment. That is why we must restructure our
daily lives to accomodate this lofty goal. I'd like each of you to dig
deeply into your well of motivation, and re-evaluate your
convictions... To imagine a bold new future without losing sight of
the realities around you. That is the key. I am certain that many of
you have your own visions of the future... For us to reap the full
benefits of our education, your participation, ideas, and enthusiasm
are essential. Thank you.
[Mitsuru steps back from the podium as the audience applauses. Focus shifts
back to Main, Yukari, and Junpei.]
JUNPEI: Dang... That was freaking amazing... So... Do you have any idea what
she just said?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Sure didn't sound like somethin' a high-schooler would say...
If it was anyone else, we'd be laughin' our asses off.
JUNPEI: Me neither... We live in the same dorm, but it's like we're on
different planets... Man, if she asks for my opinion, I don't
know what I'll say...
JUNPEI: Dude... You're such a rebel...

=== AFTERNOON ===

[Ms. Toriumi is teaching Composition.]
MS. TORIUMI: All right, today we'll be going over Meiji-era literature. Open
your textbooks to page 12. Oh... Hmm, I don't really like this
author. Okay, never mind. I've got a great poem we can cover
instead. Close your textbooks, everyone, and listen... "Beyond
the seas, high above in the skies..."
MAIN: 
MS. TORIUMI: All right, Kenji, you'd better not be sleeping back there!
You should be ashamed of yourself, taking a nap while I
pour my heart into reading this poem! For that, you get
another essay along with your regular assignment tonight!
I'll expect a slice of cake when you turn it in, too!
increased.
[Main puts his head down.]
eyes... You start to feel better... Your condition is
now "Great"!

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

HELP: AS OF TODAY, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO USE YOUR TIME AFTER SCHOOL AS YOU WISH.
IF YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED SOCIAL LINKS, YOU MAY WISH TO SPEND TIME WITH
THOSE INDIVIDUALS. ALSO, THERE ARE MANY PLACES YOU CAN GO TO IN THE AREA
TO RAISE YOUR CHARM, COURAGE, AND ACADEMICS. BE SURE TO LOOK AROUND TOWN
AS WELL AS IN THE SCHOOL.
[Main leaves the school and stands near the front gate. Akihiko exits the
school building and is immediately surrounded by fangirls.]
AKIHIKO FAN: Look, it's Akihiko-senpai!
GIDDY SCHOOLGIRL: Where!? ...Oh, there he is!
AKIHIKO: ......
[Junpei walks in and stands next to Main.]
JUNPEI: Have you noticed how popular Akihiko-san is with the ladies? Man, take
a look at that...I didn't use to talk to him much, but now I've got a
good excuse. I know he's the captain of the boxing team, but... Who
woulda thought he'd be such a chick magnet!? I mean, come on! You
don't even see girls flock like that on TV! I wonder where they're
going...
[Akihiko starts to move forward again; the girls follow him.]
AKIHIKO FAN: Senpai!
GIDDY SCHOOLGIRL: Wait for us!
AKIHIKO: Hey, are you guys free this afternoon?
JUNPEI: Hell yeah! Whatcha got in mind!?
AKIHIKO: I want the two of you to meet me at Paulownia Mall. You know where it
is, right? I'll be at the police station. See ya there.
JUNPEI: Th-The police station? You mean, we're not hangin' out with your
friends...?
AKIHIKO: Who, these girls? I don't even know their names. They talk so much
they give me a headache. Anyway, I'm gonna head out. ...Don't keep me
waiting.
[Akihiko leaves.]
AKIHIKO FAN: Awww... Why can't he be more friendly?
ADMIRER: But, that's what makes him so cool!
[The girls run off after Akihiko.]
JUNPEI: Man, how can he not know their names!? I mean, seriously! Just look at
them! ...Oh well, let's go.
decide to head over there...
[Main and Junpei go to Paulownia and enter the Police Station. Akihiko is
talking to a cop behind the counter.]
AKIHIKO: Thank you, Sir. Oh, these are the guys I was talking about earlier.
OFFICER KUROSAWA: ......
AKIHIKO: I was waiting for you guys. This is Officer Kurosawa. He helps keep
our squad well-equipped. And, this is from Ikutsuki-san...
JUNPEI: R-Really!? Sweet!
AKIHIKO: You can't fight something empty-handed, so find something you like.
Officer Kurosawa has connections... But, these things still cost
money.
OFFICER KUROSAWA: Of course they do. Nothing in life is free.
AKIHIKO: I realize that. Well, I'll see you later. Thanks again.
[Akihiko leaves.]
OFFICER KUROSAWA: I've been informed about you two. My job is to maintain
peace in this city, regardless of the circumstances. I'm just
an ordinary police officer, but it doesn't take a genius to
know something strange is going on here. I'm only doing what
I think is right.
[After shopping, Main and Junpei exit the police station.]
JUNPEI: Pshh, only 5,000 yen... I'm gonna take off, since I'm in a bad mood
now... Later.
[After exploring the town, Main returns to the dorm.]

=== EVENING ===

MITSURU: Welcome back. Perfect timing... I'd like to speak to you for a moment.
Regarding our exploration of Tartarus... Akihiko is still on the mend,
so for now, I'd like you to lead the team. You never know when a
powerful enemy might appear, like the one you faced the other day.
It's best to be prepared, or else you may find yourself in a difficult
situation. So, whenever you'd like to explore Tartarus, just let me
know, and I'll gather everyone there. Also, since I'm sure there are
other things you will need to take care of, you may go out at night if
you need to. Well, that's it. Keep up the good work.
HELP: YOU ARE NOW ABLE TO GO OUT AT NIGHT.

=== DARK HOUR ===

MITSURU: As we explore Tartarus, this will be our temporary base of
operations. I'm counting on you.
HELP: TALK TO YOUR ALLIES TO CHECK THEIR STATUS OR CHANGE THEIR
EQUIPMENT.
MITSURU: By the way, I found out something about Tartarus. A few
floors up, there's a barricade preventing you from going any
higher. The tower seems to have a number of these interspersed
amongst its floors. I know I told you that the layout changes
each day, but these barriers seem to be in fixed locations.
Therefore, I'd like you to try and reach the first barricade.
I'm counting on you.

=== VELVET ROOM ===

IGOR: Ah, there you are. Welcome to the Velvet Room. Well... I suppose
it's time for me to explain what I really do here. It is my job
to create new Personas. But in order to do so, I must fuse your
Persona cards together... In other words, I shall merge them into
a single Persona. Futhermore, if you've established a Social
Link, you may be able to create an even stronger Persona. So, as
you accumulate cards, please bring them to me.
ELIZABETH: How may I help you?

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Kenji there.]
KENJI TOMOCHIKA: What's up, Main? Huh...? You're all by yourself? Dude, I
thought the rumor about you and Yukari-san was true...
MAIN: 
KENJI TOMOCHIKA: ...Oh yeah? Well, it's not like I care or anything. But,
you've sure had some bad luck since you transferred here. ...You know,
dude, all the weird stuff that's been happening... How everyone's been
saying they're hearing strange voices... Well, I guess since you're
always listening to your headphones, you probably haven't heard anything.
[Main and Kenji enter the school.]

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Main is sitting at his desk.]
were talking to earlier this morning...
KENJI TOMOCHIKA: Hey, man, I'm gonna get some ramen after school. You wanna
come?
MAIN: 
KENJI TOMOCHIKA: No reason, really. I just don't have anything to do later...
and I thought we could finish our conversation from this
morning. So whaddya say, man? Let's get some ramen and talk.
Social Link is the strength of the Persona. You have decided to go with him.
[The scene changes to the ramen shop. Main and Kenji are eating.]
KENJI: ...Whew! Now that's what I'm talkin'
about! ...Well, was I right, or was I right? This ramen tastes great,
doesn't it? I bet they put a special ingredient in it--something no
other ramen shop uses. It's probably some sort of secret spice... Oh,
sorry. My bad. I get all geeked up when I eat here.
MAIN: 
KENJI: You do? Really? I mean, you can appreciate the subtle yet
disctinct flavor of the soup? ...Wow, you don't look like the
type of guy I'd normally hang around with... But I guess looks
aren't everything.
KENJI: Yeah, man, you're right. If we talk too much, the noodles will
get soggy. ...It's just that by the way you're savoring your
soup, it seems like you really appreciate its flavor.
KENJI: ...By the way, man, I hear you and Yukari are close. Damn, boy, you
move fast! I mean, you just transferred here. ...I can't blame you,
though. A man's gotta be aggressive nowadays. Hey, let's hang out after
school again sometime. We'll get some food and I'll tell you about my
secret plan... Wait 'til you hear it, dude. You're gonna flip!
mysterious voice rings in your head...
[The Magician Card appears.]
ARCANA: Thou shalt have our blessing when thou choosest to create a Persona of
the Magician Arcana...
HELP: YOU MAY BE ABLE TO CREATE A SOCIAL LINK BY GETTING TO KNOW A PERSON
BETTER. WHEN YOU FUSE PERSONAS, THE STRENGTH OF THE SOCIAL LINK WILL
AFFECT THE RESULTING PERSONA. WHEN YOU CREATE A PERSONA THAT HAS THE SAME
ARCANA AS A SOCIAL LINK... YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GAIN ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE
FOR THAT PERSONA! TRY TO DISCOVER AS MANY SOCIAL LINKS AS YOU CAN AND
FUSE AS MANY PERSONAS AS POSSIBLE!
KENJI: What, it's already nighttime? ...Damn, I missed my favorite TV show!
Man, you're one serious dude... Oh well, let's get going.

=== EVENING ===

MITSURU: Welcome back. , have you been monitoring your condition?
Exploring Tartarus can be exhausting, especially since you must do so
late at night. You may find that you need a great deal of rest to
recuperate. The others' conditions will vary as well, so make sure you
take that into consideration before you begin exploring. If you want
my evalutaion of everyone's condition, don't hesitate to ask.
HELP: THOSE WHO FIGHT IN TARTARUS WILL QUICKLY BECOME "TIRED," AND MAY REQUIRE
SEVERAL DAYS OF REST TO RECUPERATE. IT WOULD BE UNWISE TO VENTURE INTO
TARTARUS IN SUCH A STATE, SO BE SURE TO CHECK EACH MEMBER'S CONDITION
BEFOREHAND.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Is it just me, or have there been more weird people around
lately?
LISTENING STUDENT: You're talking about the Apathy Syndrome, right? My neighbor
has that... He grosses me out. Sometimes I think I might
have it too, and it depresses me.
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Maybe you just need some exercise. Hey, the athletic teams
are accepting new members. Maybe I should join!
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

recruiting. If you can find the appropriate room, you might be able to join.

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? Hey, I hear you're friends with Kenji now... He said
you're a pretty cool guy...
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Don't get too cocky, man... But yeah, I'm sure you two will
get along just fine.
JUNPEI: Well, sort of... I've known him for a long time, even though
we don't usually hang out. He's a good guy... and, man, he has
no fear when it comes to the ladies...
JUNPEI: By the way, let's go to Tartarus tonight... I hear the Lost are
increasing, so we better kick some Shadow ass.

=== EVENING ===

YUKARI: ...Oh, hey. Hey, Main-kun. Have you joined any clubs?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Oh, yeah? That's cool. ...You seem pretty talented, so I'm not
surprised.
YUKARI: Well, don't wait too long, cuz they fill up quickly.
YUKARI: Oh, by the way, maybe we should go to Tartarus tonight... With all The
Lost, I think we should do anything we can to help... Plus, I didn't
have practice today, so I could use the exercise...
MITSURU: Just don't take it lightly, okay? It's dangerous there.
YUKARI: I'm aware of that.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
LISTENING STUDENT: Oh hey, you know the bookstore at the strip mall? Isn't
their grand reopening today?
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Huh? A bookstore?
LISTENING STUDENT: Yeah, leave Iwatodai Station, go straight for a while, and
it's after you cross the crosswalk. We've been at this
school for a while... You should explore more often!
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

reopening today.

=== EVENING ===

AKIHIKO: ...Where have you been? ...Ya know, you better be training while I'm
out. If anything happens, it'll be you guys who have to deal with it.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[If you've made plans with a friend, you will automatically leave to hang out
with them.]

=== DAYTIME ===

HELP: IF YOU GO OUTSIDE, WHEN YOU COME BACK TO THE DORM, IT WILL BECOME
NIGHTTIME.

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Morning... Ugh, I'm so drowsy on Mondays...
LISTENING STUDENT: Didn't you say the same thing last week? Is that special
morning assembly today? How come we're having one? We just
had one last week...
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Remember how great Kirijo-senpai's speech was last week?
LISTENING STUDENT: Oh yeah, that speech was awesome! Although, I didn't
understand most of it...
GOSSIPING STUDENT: What I heard was, the principal got jealous, so he scheduled
his own speech to compete with her.
LISTENING STUDENT: Seriously!? What's up with that? Why do we have to suffer
because of his ego!?
[Main and the girls enter the school. The scene changes to the auditorium. The
principal and a teacher are on stage.]
TEACHER: We'll now begin this morning's assembly. First, our principal has some
words he'd like to share with you. Please give him a warm welcome.
PRINCIPAL: ...Thank you.
[The teacher leaves the podium and the principal walks over to it. Focus shifts
to Main, Yukari, and Junpei in the seats.]
YUKARI: What's the deal with the assembly? ...You think it's about the recent
incidents?
JUNPEI: Who cares? The Principal doesn't know anything about the Shadows,
anyway. I just hope this doesn't take too long...
YUKARI: I know. His speeches always drag.
[The focus shifts back to the principal on stage.]
PRINCIPAL: Ahem. Today, I'd like to tell you about my, um, vision for this
school year. As you are aware, strange incidents have been reported
on the news lately. It is my firm belief that none of you are
involved. However, if we want to better our school, then we all need
to accept responsibility for change. Dig deep down inside, and tap
into your imaginations. ...But don't lose touch with reality. As
they say, "There's no use crying over spilt milk." This is the key
to reaping all the rewards that school has to offer...
[Focus shifts back to Main, Yukari, and Junpei.]
YUKARI: Wait a minute... Doesn't this remind you of Mitsuru-senpai's speech?
JUNPEI: Yeah, you're right... What's up with that!?

=== LUNCHTIME ===

[Main is sitting at his desk. Mitsuru approaches him.]
MITSURU: ... I'm sorry, but I need to talk to you after school. I
have a special request for you.
MAIN: 
MITSURU: I apologize for being in a rush, but I don't feel comfortable asking
anyone else. I'll tell you more about it after school, okay?
Au revoir.

=== AFTERNOON ===

[Ms. Miyahara is teaching Math.]
MS. MIYAHARA: ...Then round up, so... The answer is X=1. Hmm? It isn't? Oh, I
see, this becomes 11, so... I'm sorry, you're right. X=2. Wait...
is that right? Okay, uh, your assignment is to figure this one
out. Anyway... Wasn't that incredible? Even with a difficult
problem like this one, once you solve it, X still equals 1. Or
maybe 2. What I'm getting at is, math is fun! Don't you think so?
All right. Today is the 27th, so that works out to... your turn,
Main.
[Main stands up.]
MS. MIYAHARA: What's 1+1?
MAIN: 
MS. MIYAHARA: You're right. It's a simple question, so the fundamentals
are obvious. No matter what, 1 plus 1 is 2. It doesn't
matter what you're counting. Atoms, students, if one
joins another, there's 2 of them. That's math for you.
Isn't it amazing?
MS. MIYAHARA: You still don't seem to understand the principles of
mathematics. Did you think such a simple question must be
a trick? That's not a very mathematical way of thinking.
You have to think mathematically. That's all I ask of
you. By the way, as a number, "one" is...

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Main is sitting at his desk. Mitsuru approaches him.]
MITSURU: I apologize for making you wait. To make a long story short, I want
you to join Student Council.
MAIN: 
[Why all of a sudden...?]
MITSURU: Well, it's not like you have to participate in every activity. Just
come to the Student Council Room when you have the time.
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Yes, that's it. I just want you to join.
MITSURU: ...Because of your leadership ability.
MITSURU: Being President is very time consuming. I'd like to have additional
help available in the event of an emergency. You understand my
situation... I'm asking you since you know what it's like to be a
leader.
MAIN: 
MITSURU: I knew I could count on you. ...I've already made an appointment for
you with the faculty advisor. But, you'll have to go to the Faculty
Office on your own.
her that you are interested.
MITSURU: I'm sorry I made the arrangements without your permission, but I hope
you understand the position I'm in. Please go to the Faculty Office,
. I'll be waiting for you in the Student Council Room.

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? Yo! I heard Mitsuru-senpai asked you to join Student
Council! Senpai, are you sure you wanna let this slacker in?
MITSURU: I simply asked for his assistance. I don't intend to burden him with
too many responsibilities. Why, are you interested in helping too,
Iori?
JUNPEI: Oh, uhhh... I'll pass. But, thanks for the offer.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Mitsuru there.]
MITSURU: Good morning. ...Have you acclimated to our school yet?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: I see. Your ability to adapt to new situations and
environments is very impressive.
MITSURU: Well, that's understandable. So much seems to be happening
these days.
MITSURU: By the way, there's something I forgot to tell you... Most times you
can find me in the lounge. However, I won't be there if there is
something I must attend to. So, if I'm not in the lounge, we will
explore Tartarus the following day.
[Main and Mitsuru enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

MITSURU: Welcome back. For your information... The internet line which was
ripped apart by the Shadow will be fixed tomorrow. If you have a
computer in your room, you should be able to connect. ...Well, that
takes care of everything that was damaged... except, of course,
Akihiko's rib cage.
JUNPEI: Speaking of the internet... You play any online games, dude?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: You know, those games you play with a buncha people ya never
met before. I was totally addicted to this one game, but then I
got burned out... Here, you can have it... It's called
"Innocent Sin Online."
JUNPEI: Nice. Dude, you gotta check this one out... It's called
"Innocent Sin Online." I was totally addicted to it, but then
I got burned out... Give it a try.

=== EARLY MORNING ===


=== EVENING ===


=== AFTERNOON ===

[Mr. Ono is teaching Japanese History.]
MR. ONO: Let's see... Today we'll discuss shell middens. Shell middens are a
bunch of shells in heaps. That's all you need to know. I can't wait
until we get to the Sengoku era... It's so exciting! Speaking of the
Sengoku era, there was a general who was called "the war hawk of the
battlefield."
your eyes for a few minutes?
MAIN: 
MR. ONO: ...And that's how the period came to be known as the Sengoku
era. Huh? You want to hear more about shell middens? Well,
let's save that for next week.
increased.
[Main puts his head down.]
eyes... You start to feel better... Your condition is
now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===

[Main has just arrived at the dorm when his phone rings.]
VOICE ON THE PHONE: Hello? This is Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH: Please come to the Velvet Room. There is a matter we need to
discuss. You may use the alternate entrance located in Paulownia
Mall. All you must do is find the door. ...I'll see you soon.
MITSURU: Welcome back. (Last Name]... I'd like to speak to you for a moment.
It's been 10 days since you first entered Tartarus, and you haven't
done a thing. Who do you think you are? At first, I thought you had a
plan, but now I can see that you've just been slacking off. If you
recall, I told you that you would have a difficult time later if you
don't adequately train. Was it a mistake to appoint you the leader?
We are going to Tartarus tonight. Understood? Don't disappoint me.
MAIN: 
MITSURU: I don't want to hear any excuses. You've had plenty of time.
We're going tonight, whether you like it or not. ...Now, go
get ready.

=== DARK HOUR ===

MITSURU: You've been slacking off lately... If you don't train
regularly, then you'll be putting your own life and the lives
of your allies in jeopardy. ...Just remember that. ...I'll
briefly explain about Tartarus once more. As we explore
Tartarus, this will be our temporary base of operations. I'm
counting on you.
HELP: TALK TO YOUR ALLIES TO CHECK THEIR STATUS OR CHANGE THEIR
EQUIPMENT.
MITSURU: Stop. I'm not letting you go today.

=== VELVET ROOM ===

ELIZABETH: I am truly sorry to bother you, but... I have a big favor to ask.
I have been looking for someone with exceptional strength. It's been
quite some time since we've had a visitor worthy of our attention.
If you don't mind, will you accept my requests? Of course, once each
request is completed, I will have a reward for you. I anxiously
await your cooperation.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Yukari there.]
YUKARI: Mornin'. It's getting warmer, huh? Well, it IS May already... It's
amazing how time flies...
MAIN: 
YUKARI: So much has been happening... Ya know, it doesn't seem like the number
of Apathy Syndrome cases has been decreasing lately... We're the only
ones who can fight the Shadows, so... I guess we should train more, so
that we're ready if anything like THAT comes up again. ...Me
especially. I don't wanna be a burden on everyone else.
[Main and Yukari enter the school.]

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Main and Junpei are talking in their homeroom.]
JUNPEI: FYI, Akihiko-san's at the hospital getting a checkup. He called me
earlier, and asked me to bring him something. Yup, he knows who to
count on.
[Yukari walks over.]
YUKARI: He only asked you cuz you don't have anything else to do after school.
JUNPEI: H-Hey, I resent that.
YUKARI: I'm just kidding. So, what'd he want you to bring?
JUNPEI: The class roster for 2-E.
YUKARI: What's he want that for? ...Well, I don't have practice today, so I'll
go with you.  You're coming too, right?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Cool.
JUNPEI: W-Wait a minute...
YUKARI: What? Is there a problem?
JUNPEI: Well, it was ME he asked...
YUKARI: Come on, now. I'm sure he wants us there too... It sounds
important, doesn't it?
JUNPEI: He asked ME, ya know...
YUKARI: If it's important, we should all go together. Right?
[Scene changes to Akihiko's room in the hospital. Akihiko's not there, but a
shifty-looking guy is sitting in a chair. The group enters.]
JUNPEI: Umm... Is... Akihiko-senpai...?
VISTOR: ......
JUNPEI: ...in this room? By any chance?
[Akihiko enters behind them.]
AKIHIKO: What are all of you guys doing here?
YUKARI: We came to see you! But... it doesn't look like anything's wrong with
you.
AKIHIKO: I'm just here for a checkup.
[The visitor stands up.]
VISITOR: Is that it, Aki?
AKIHIKO: Yeah, thanks.
VISITOR: Tch... I don't have time for this shit.
[The visitor gets up to leave, and Junpei moves out of his way as he exits.]
JUNPEI: Wh-Who was that?
AKIHIKO: A friend from school... sort of. You know how the number of Apathy
Syndrome cases have been increasing? Well, he knows a few people who
are suffering from it, so I was asking him about it. Hey Junpei, did
you bring what I asked?
JUNPEI: Of course, Senpai.
[Akihiko nods and tests his arm with a punch to the air.]
JUNPEI: Uh, you shouldn't move your arm...
AKIHIKO: It's nothing. I've wasted enough time already. I need to get back to
my training.
JUNPEI: Yeah! Gekkoukan's golden boy! He was born to be in the ring!
AKIHIKO: Sometimes, I really don't get you.
YUKARI: By the way, Senpai, why boxing?
AKIHIKO: You mean, why did I choose that sport? Well... It's not the sport
itself I like; I just wanted to learn how to fight. I know what it's
like to feel powerless... and I don't want to feel that way again.
Besides, I'm curious to see how strong I can get. It's like a game,
only I'm competing against myself.
JUNPEI: That's an interesting way of looking at it. Ya know, I'm into games
too...
YUKARI: Yeah, VIDEO games.
JUNPEI: Hey, they're good for hand-eye coordination!

=== EVENING ===

MITSURU: Welcome back. A long weekend is coming up, so I suggest we go to
Tartarus. It may take some time for Akihiko to fully heal, and I don't
want anything like that to happen again. Besides, the number of
victims seems to have been increasing. ...I have a bad feeling about
that. We had best muster as much strength as we can.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Golden Week starts tomorrow. Have you got any plans?
LISTENING STUDENT: Ehh... Not really. But I'm not gonna miss tomorrow's show!
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Oh, yeah! You mean Tanaka's show, right? When I hear that
jingle, I can't resist buying something... I never miss it
when it's on Sunday afternoons. I'm about to go broke!
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? Three-day weekend starting tomorrow! I asked some peeps
if they wanted to hang out, but the only ones interested were guys...
Man, I don't want no sausage fest...
MITSURU: I don't mean to interrupt, but need I remind you that midterms are
quickly approaching? You had best use your time wisely.
YUKARI: You HAD to remind me...

=== DARK HOUR ===

MYSTERIOUS BOY: Hi, how've you been?
[Main is in his bed. The boy is sitting on the edge.]
MYSTERIOUS BOY: 
MAIN: 
MYSTERIOUS BOY: It's been a while. Are you well?
MYSTERIOUS BOY: What kind of welcome is that? Besides, I'm always with
you.
MYSTERIOUS BOY: One week from now, there will be a full moon... Be careful.
A new ordeal awaits you...
MAIN: 
MYSTERIOUS BOY: Yes, on such days you will face your greatest
challenges.
MYSTERIOUS BOY: You will encounter one of THEM.
MYSTERIOUS BOY: You must prepare for the ordeal, but time is of the essence...
I'm sure you're aware of that, of course.
[The boy disappears and reappears at the foot of the bed.]
MYSTERIOUS BOY: I'll come see you again when it's over. Goodbye for now.

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude?

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
LISTENING STUDENT: ... Golden Week is over. I'm pretty sad... You know,
rabbits can die from sadness.
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Okay... First, you're not a rabbit. And second, that's just
a rumor.
LISTENING STUDENT: What? No way! I thought it was scientific fact... But
speaking of being sad... I saw an elementary school kid at
Naganaki Shrine the last time I visited. She looked so sad
playing all by herself. I felt sorry for her...
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Ms. Ounishi is teaching Chemistry.]
MS. OUNISHI: I don't feel like teaching today... I was watching TV last
night, and there was a special on weight loss. "The more you
drink, the thinner you get!" Yeah, right! What about the osmotic
pressure, huh? It's misinformation, but people believe what they
see on TV... You remember that craze about the soap that makes you
thinner? That was more bull. Soap is nothing but fatty acid salt.
You know how soap works, right? You look like you know the answer,
Main... Surprise me.
[Main stands up.]
MS. OUNISHI: Is soap acidic, basic, or neutral?
MAIN: 
MS. OUNISHI: Wrong! Soaps are basic. Human skin is slightly acidic, so
rubbing a base on it can irritate your skin. You know
those pH-balanced "soaps"? They're most likely synthetic
detergents, since soaps are basic. Don't believe
everything you see on TV, kids! All right, moving on...
MS. OUNISHI: You got it. I guess you're smarter than you look. Human
skin is slightly acidic, so rubbing a base on it can
irritate your skin. You know those pH-balanced "soaps"?
They're most likely synthetic detergents, since soaps are
basic. Don't believe everything you see on TV, kids! All
right, moving on...

=== EVENING ===

YUKARI: ...Oh, hey. Main-kun, let's go to Tartarus tonight... I'm getting
worried since nothing's happened since that one day... Is it just me,
or are more people getting Apathy Syndrome lately? I have a feeling
something bad is going to happen. ...Or, am I just being paranoid?

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? Hey, have you noticed how many of those freaks there are
in town lately...? Other than that, nothin's been going on... Man, talk
about boring... Let's go to Tartarus for a little action.
AKIHIKO: Maybe I should come along... I'm dying of boredom, too.
MITSURU: ...Akihiko, are you trying to make me angry?

=== EVENING ===

MITSURU: Welcome back. ...It's odd, really, how quiet it's been.
AKIHIKO: You're referring to the Shadows, I take it?
MITSURU: It's been a month since the last attack, yet I'm certain that won't
be the last time they appear outside of Tartarus.
AKIHIKO: True... Lately, it seems like The Lost are everywhere. So, something
must be going on...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Akihiko there.]
AKIHIKO: Hey, Main. How's it going? Have you been training in Tartarus?
MAIN: 
AKIHIKO: Great, keep it up.
AKIHIKO: Well, don't take it too easy.
AKIHIKO: It never hurts to train while you have the chance. My wounds will heal
in no time, and then I'll be able to join you on the front line. But,
don't just rely on me.

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

You wonder if something will happen. You should probably head back to the
dorm just to be on the safe side.

=== DARK HOUR ===

[Mitsuru is sitting in the meeting room, listening to frequencies on a radio.
Akihiko enters.]
MITSURU: 
AKIHIKO: You're still at it?
MITSURU: Yeah. You never know when the enemy might appear.
AKIHIKO: But, I thought you couldn't scan outside of Tartarus?
MITSURU: To be honest, I lack the power... Maybe this is the best Penthesilea
can do in terms of data gathering. Although, the power of Persona
seems to be much broader than I thought. We've even got someone who
can switch Personas in the middle of battle. There's something special
about his ability. It hasn't been that long since his awakening,
either.
AKIHIKO: I have to admit, I was surprised too. But in the end, it's up to him
whether or not he can reach his full potential.
[Mitsuru continues to listen in with the radio.]
MITSURU: Huh...? It's a Shadow!
AKIHIKO: What!? You actually found one!?
MITSURU: Wait, something's not right. The reading is too big. We've never
encountered anything like--
AKIHIKO: You mean, it's one of those!?
MITSURU: ...It must be.
AKIHIKO: Well then, this is gonna be fun. I'll wake up the others.
[Mitsuru nods and Akihiko presses a switch on the panel that turns on an alarm.
A few minutes later, the others arrive in the meeting room.]
YUKARI: We're here!
JUNPEI: Where is it!? I'll rip it a new one!
MITSURU: We've detected a Shadow outside of Tartarus. We don't know for sure,
but we think it's another big one. We have to defeat any of them we
find, as quickly as possible. Most people don't know the Dark Hour
exists. But, if half the city is destroyed, there will be panic. That
must be avoided at all costs.
JUNPEI: In other words, we need to kick some ass, right? Well, count me in!
YUKARI: Junpei...
MITSURU: Akihiko, you stay here and wait for the Chairman.
AKIHIKO: Wha--!? Are you kidding!? I'm going!
MITSURU: You still need to recover. You'll just be a hindrance.
AKIHIKO: Tch!
MITSURU: They'll fare better than you, in your current state. Have faith in
them, Akihiko... They're ready. You'll get your chance. But for now,
wait for the Chairman.
AKIHIKO: ...... Dammit...
JUNPEI: Relax! I've got it covered!
AKIHIKO: I guess I've got no choice... You're in charge.
JUNPEI: Him again...?
MITSURU: We're counting on you...
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Yes, you can. You've done fine until now, right?
JUNPEI: Who cares? They chose you, didn't they? Same as always.
JUNPEI: Heh, looks like you're stuck playin' leader again... Sucks to be you.
AKIHIKO: You should let the three of them go first. If you're
providing backup out there, you'll need time to get ready, right?
MITSURU: Wait for me in front of the station. I'll be there as soon as I can.
YUKARI: Got it. Alright, let's go!
[Later, Main, Yukari, and Junpei are waiting on the steps of the monorail
station.]
YUKARI: Where is she?
[Junpei takes a drink from a bottle.]
JUNPEI: She'll be here soon.
YUKARI: There's a full moon tonight... But, it looks even creepier during the
Dark Hour...
JUNPEI: ...Huh? What the!?
[Mitsuru arrives on her motorcycle and takes off her helmet.]
MITSURU: Sorry to keep you waiting. Listen carefully. Tonight, I'll be
providing support from here. Everything else is the same. The Shadow
is currently located inside a monorail, not far from the station.
To get there, you'll have to walk on the tracks.
JUNPEI: Are you serious!? Isn't that dangerous...?
MITSURU: Don't worry, no electronic equipment is operable during the Dark Hour,
including the monorails.
JUNPEI: But, your bike...
MITSURU: It's special. Now, if circumstances change, I'll notify you
immediately.
[Mitsuru's transceiver beeps.]
MITSURU: Let's get started.
YUKARI: Okay.
JUNPEI: L-Let's do this!
[The scene changes and the party is now out on the tracks. Tartarus can be
seen in the background.]
MITSURU: There's a monorail about 200 meters ahead. You have
to stop the Shadows before they harm the passengers. Hurry!
[The party follows the tracks until they find a stopped monorail.]
YUKARI: This is it...right?
MITSURU: Can you all hear me?
YUKARI: Yes, I can hear you clearly. We just got here, but I don't see anything
out of the ordinary...
MITSURU: The readings are definately coming from that
monorail. Proceed with caution, and stay together.
YUKARI: Got it.
JUNPEI: Heheh, my Persona's just beggin' to be used!
[The party moves over to a ladder on the side of the monorail. Yukari begins
to climb up, then turns around and holds her hand over her skirt.]
YUKARI: ...Don't look up.
[The others enter the monorail and move into the rear car. A coffin is standing
up on one side; Junpei walks over to it.]
JUNPEI: This poor stiff must be a passenger... He's been Transmogged, huh...
Creepy. So... guys like him don't remember a thing, right? It's
probably better that way.
YUKARI: Huh...? Wait a minute. We're not at a station, but the doors are wide--
[One of the doors suddenly closes.]
YUKARI: !?
[Junpei runs to the next door to hold it open but it closes on him.]
JUNPEI: Damn, it won't open! Ow, my fingers! Will ya look at them! They're all
jacked up!
MITSURU: What's wrong? What happened!?
YUKARI: It looks like we're trapped inside...
MITSURU: It must be the Shadow... It knows you're there. Be
ready for anything! Proceed with extreme caution!
YUKARI: R-Roger!
[The party moves ahead to the next car.]
JUNPEI: What the heck? I don't see any Shadows...
[The party moves further through the car.]
YUKARI: It's so quiet it's creepy...
[The party approaches the door to the next car when a Shadow drops down from
above.]
YUKARI: 
JUNPEI: There it is!
[The Shadow opens the door to the next car and leaves. Junpei begins to follow
it.]
MITSURU: Wait! Something's not right... The enemy is acting
strangely.
JUNPEI: But, if we don't go after it, we're gonna lose it!
MITSURU: Main, you're in charge over there. What do you think?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: I agree. It would be foolish to blindly
chase after it.
MITSURU: But, why did it retreat after revealing
itself? It doesn't make sense.
MITSURU: I can't give you any more information,
either. Be careful.
JUNPEI: Who needs your advice!? We can beat that thing no problem!
Hell, I'll do it myself!
[Junpei runs to the next car.]
YUKARI: Junpei! Wait!
MITSURU: Watch out! Behind you!
[Two Shadows drop down behind Main and Yukari. They manage to defeat the
Shadows.]
YUKARI: This is just what the enemy wanted...
MITSURU: We have no choice. You have to go after him, or
you'll be picked off, one by one.
YUKARI: Dammit, Stupei! What are you thinking!?
MITSURU: From what I can tell, he's only a few cars ahead.
YUKARI: Okay, we'll catch up to--
[Two more Shadows enter from the next car.]
YUKARI: Gah! Get out of our way!!
[Another Shadow drops from the ceiling. Main and Yukari defeat the Shadows and
move on to the next car.]
YUKARI: Junpei's not in this car, either.  He should know it's too
dangerous to go alone... Don't you think he's acting weird? Did you say
something to upset him, Main-kun? Well, we can ask him once we've
caught up to him!
[Main and Yukari move on ahead through the cars. They spot Junpei fighting
Shadows in the fourth car.]
YUKARI: There he is! Shoot! He's surrounded!? We've gotta help him!
[They run closer to Junpei.]
YUKARI: Junpei!
JUNPEI: ...I've got it under control! Take this, you freak of nature!
[Main and Yukari help Junpei fight off the Shadows.]
YUKARI: See! That's what happens when you don't listen! ...So, are you alright?
JUNPEI: O-Of course I am... I was doin' just fine...
YUKARI: Excuse me!?
MITSURU: Be careful, you three! I don't detect any movement,
but stay alert!
[The party looks around. The monorail rumbles and begins moving forward along
the tracks.]
JUNPEI: Whoa, what the!? ...Why're we moving!?
MITSURU: It seems the monorail is under the enemy's control...
YUKARI: Whaddya mean, "it seems"!?
[The monorail speeds up.]
JUNPEI: Uh... This doesn't look good.
MITSURU: ...If we can't stop that thing, it'll crash into
another train!
YUKARI: WHAT!? Oh, God! What are we gonna do!?
MITSURU: Calm down and listen. I sense a strong presence in
the front car. That must be the one we're after. You'll have to defeat
it to stop the train!
[More Shadows drop down in front of the party.]
JUNPEI: What kind of messed-up ride is this!?
[The party defeats the Shadows.]
MITSURU: You don't have much time! Run!
[The party moves ahead to the second car. The monorail begins going even
faster.]
YUKARI: H-Hey!? We're gaining speed!
[The party makes it to the front car.]
JUNPEI: There it is...!
[A massive Shadow that looks like a large female is blocking the way to the
engine controls.]
JUNPEI: What the hell!? ...Is this the friggin' boss?
YUKARI: We're in the front car; it's gotta be!
MITSURU: Hurry!
[After a hard battle, the party manages to kill the Shadow.]
JUNPEI: Did we make it in time?
[Junpei looks out the windows.]
JUNPEI: ...Hey! Why're we still moving!?
YUKARI: We're going too fast! We have to put on the brakes or else...!
MITSURU: What are you waiting for!? There's a train up ahead!
JUNPEI: Dammit! I don't know how to stop this thing!
YUKARI: Kyaaah!
[Main runs to the controls and manages to apply the brakes in time.]
JUNPEI: D-Did we stop...?
YUKARI: I-I think so...
MITSURU: Is everybody alright!?
YUKARI: Uh, y-yeah, we're okay. Ha, haa... My knees are shaking...
JUNPEI: Dude... I'm like drenched in sweat...
MITSURU: I'm so glad you're safe... I'm sorry I
couldn't do more on my end. I don't detect any more Shadows. You guys
did a great job, so come on home.
YUKARI: But, how did you know which one was the brake?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: You saved me again. ...Thanks.
JUNPEI: Are you shittin' me!? Ah, whatever. Wanna grab a bite to eat?
I'm freakin' hungry!
[Fool Arcana to rank 3. The scene fades out.]
all has grown. You learned a new tactic! You can now use "Conserve SP"!
[The scene changes to the meeting room back at the dorm, where Akihiko and
Ikutsuki are. There's a beep on the control panel.]
AKIHIKO: Akihiko here.
MITSURU: This is Mitsuru. We've successfully completed the
operation. The monorail didn't sustain any noticeable damage.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Thank you, Mitsuru. When I'd heard they hijacked a monorail,
I feared the worst. Well done. Now, I don't have to worry about
tomorrow's headlines.
MITSURU: The team did a great job. They're learning quickly.
AKIHIKO: But, what are the Shadows up to? Taking over a monorail... This is
getting out of hand.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I'll be looking into the matter.
MITSURU: Does this mean... it's begun?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Hmmm... Let's not jump to any conclusions. For now, we should
study their behavior for patterns or clues. We cannot afford to
always wait for them to make the first move.
MITSURU: If I had more power, things wouldn't be so difficult
for the others.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Don't be so hard on yourself. You're doing fine. More
importantly... Do you have anything to drink, Akihiko?
AKIHIKO: Huh...? Why do you look so tired, Ikutsuki-san? Wait... Don't tell me
that bicycle outside is yours!
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Boy, am I gonna be sore tomorrow!
[The scene fades out.]
seems as if the prediction came true. You wonder what it means... ...... You
are too exhausted to make any sense of it right now. You decide to rest as
soon as you get back to the dorm...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main is sitting on his bed watching TV. His phone begins ringing.]
VOICE ON THE PHONE: Hello? This is Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH: I'm calling to inform you of a change in Tartarus... I believe a
path that was blocked is now open... I thought you might like to
know. ...I wish you a safe journey.

=== EVENING ===


=== VELVET ROOM ===

ELIZABETH: Welcome to the Velvet Room. I have something important to tell you
today. I've been asked to inform you about the Persona Compendium.
You may register any of your Personas in this book, and for a fee,
you can withdraw them at any time. Please speak with me to view the
compendium.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Junpei there.]
JUNPEI: Wazzup? Today is just an ordinary day, huh? That was crazy though, the
day before yesterday. I've never had that kinda thrill in all my
life... Don't you think it's been getting more exciting lately?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Totally. ...We won the battle and saved the city... How sweet
is that!?
JUNPEI: Dude, are you crazy!? We've got the power of Persona! Plus,
we won the battle and saved the city... How sweet is that!?
[Main and Junpei enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Ekoda is teaching Classic Literature.]
MR EKODA: I'm sure you all remember that midterm exams start next Monday. If
you paid attention during class and studied diligently at home, you
should have no problems. Of course, the best way to prepare for a
difficult exam is to sleep through class, like Junpei here. Hmph...
If you choose to neglect your duty as a student and waste your life
in idleness, then be my guest...
MAIN: 
MR. EKODA: In my day, society was nowhere near as rich and abundant as
it is today...! That's why we worked so long and hard; to
better our lives. Can you young people say the same? Hmm?
Our society's material wealth has come at the cost of its
spiritual wealth... In "Ise Monogatari," on the contrary...
increased.
[Main puts his head down.]
eyes... You start to feel better... Your condition is
now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Yukari there.]
YUKARI: Mornin'. You hear the news...? There've been fewer new cases of Apathy
Syndrome the last few days. Senpai said it's probably because we beat
that Shadow. Wouldn't that be great if it was true?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: I think so, too. It was dangerous, but I'm glad we did it. We
shouldn't get carried away, though, cuz we have midterms next
week. Let's just hope nothing like that happens again until
midterms are over.
YUKARI: ...Yeah, I wondered about that. But, I hope it's not. We should
take it easy for a while, since we have midterms next week.
Let's just hope nothing like that happens again until midterms
are over.
[Main and Yukari enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

YUKARI: ...Oh, hey. I was just about to go borrow my friend's notes. Midterms
are coming up, you know... So, I'll have to pass today. ...Sorry.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Did you hear the latest? Someone on the staff was
hospitalized with some bad injuries. I heard the road
suddenly collapsed, and the guy's car fel 30 feet straight
down!
LISTENING STUDENT: Wow, I've never heard of anything like that before... Is
this school haunted?
GOSSIPING STUDENT: I know, right!? I think I just felt a chill go down my
spine... I should go to the nurse's office.
LISTENING STUDENT: Th-The nurse's office!? The same place that staffer is
resting? Are you kidding me? He'll give you that weird
medicine. You might end up feeling even worse!
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== AFTERNOON ===

[Mr. Takenozuka is teaching Physics.]
MR. TAKENOZUKA: Okay, next I'll talk a little bit about Newton. He's known for
his apple, universal gravitation, Kepler's laws, and the
inverse square rule. This will all be covered on the exam next
week, so write it down! Moving on... Next, we'll cover
Einstein. Let's see... Hmm... Main?
[Main stands up.]
MR. TAKENOZUKA: What was Einstein's famous theory? Quick!
MAIN: 
MR. TAKENOZUKA: Nope, that's not it at all. Okay, enough of Einstein.
Turn to the next page...
MR. TAKENOZUKA: You, sir, are correct. I guess that takes care of
Einstein. Turn to the next page...

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude?  I'm tired of studying. Let's go to Tartarus, bro.
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Sweet! I knew I could count on you, man! You're comin' too,
right Yuka-tan?
JUNPEI: Are you serious, bro!? Isn't saving the world more important?
C'mon... Yuka-tan wants to go...
YUKARI: We DO have exams next week... But, what the hell... I'll go.
JUNPEI: Yeaaah! Now, we're talkin'!

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? Hey, let's go to Tartarus. You can study anytime. We
need to get stronger ASAP. Me n' Hermes will take down the next big
Shadow ourselves!
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Why shouldn't I be?
JUNPEI: C'mon, gimme a break, man...
MITSURU: How are your grades, Iori?
JUNPEI: How are yours-- Never mind. I already know.
MITSURU: I'm currently studying college-level material, for your information.
JUNPEI: Man, now I don't feel like doing anything at all...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Mitsuru there.]
MITSURU: Good morning. Exams begin next week. Are you prepared?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Ah, just as I suspected. I'll be looking forward to seeing
your grades...
MITSURU: I see... A talented hawk hides its talons, hm? Well, I'll be
looking forward to seeing your grades...
MITSURU: If they're good, I'll give you something. ...Consider it a reward.
To be honest, I'm not as well prepared as I should be. I'm still
preoccupied with monitoring Shadows. At any rate, the number of
incidents have decreased since our last mission. If we can continue to
defeat them, we may be able to rid the public of their fear...
However, every time a new Shadow appears, it seems to be more powerful
than the last. And even after Akihiko returns to battle, we still
won't be at full strength...
[Main and Mitsuru enter the school.]

=== AFTERNOON ===

[Mrs. Terauchi is teaching English.]
MRS. TERAUCHI: ...Let's translate the passage on page 26 into English. The
bell's going to ring soon, so make this quick! In this section,
the red Special Guard grabs Kaya by her wrist, and she says,
"Hanashite!" Today's the 15th, so I'll pick... Main.
[Main stands up.]
MRS. TERAUCHI: When used this way, what does "hanashite" mean?
MAIN: 
MRS. TERAUCHI: Nope. Good try, though! This will be on the next exam,
so figure out the answer by then! Hmm, we're out of
time... We'll continue this passage next time.
MRS. TERAUCHI: Good job! After this, the Special Guard knocks Kaya out
and carries her away. Remember this, because it'll be on
the next exam! We've still got a couple minutes left...
Oh, in today's newspaper...

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Akihiko there.]
AKIHIKO: H-Hey.
MAIN: 
AKIHIKO: No...
AKIHIKO: The opposite, actually.
AKIHIKO: The doctor said I'm almost fully healed, so... I couldn't wait to get
some exercise. I'll be ready for battle after midterms. But, that
means I've got to start training now.
[Main and Akihiko enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Ms. Miyahara is teaching Math.]
MS. MIYAHARA: If you apply this formula to a problem, it works out to 3...
Wait, is that right? Ummm.... No, that's right. It's 3. By the
way, take a good look at this formula. Isn't it fascinating?
MAIN: 
MS. MIYAHARA: Huh? The exam...? Oh, right, the exams start next Monday.
It'll cover up to page 34. This formula won't be on it.
It's so beautiful, though... Maybe I should put it on the
exam, too. Kidding! Kidding! Don't give me that look...!
increased.
[Main puts his head down.]
eyes... You start to feel better... Your condition is
now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===

MITSURU: Welcome back.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
LISTENING STUDENT: Oh, no! The test is today! I didn't study at all yesterday,
cause... I fell asleep!
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Come on... You don't need to lie about it every time. By the
way, did you hear? Our PE teacher was hospitalized. I heard
a signboard fell on top of him.
LISTENING STUDENT: Whoa... Wait. Who cares about our PE teacher? C'mon, we've
got 5 minutes! We can memorize 10 vocab words!
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===


=== MORNING ===

Composition Q.5: Which of the following was written by Fuyuhiko Yoshimura?
MAIN: 

=== MORNING ===

Physics Q.2: Which of these is not related to the others?
MAIN: 

=== MORNING ===

Chemistry Q.2: Based on its pH, soap is considered which of the following?
MAIN: 

=== MORNING ===

Japanese History Q.1: What is the difference between the Paleolithic era and
the Neolithic era?
MAIN: 

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Akihiko there.]
AKIHIKO: Hey, Main. Today is the last day of midterms, huh. If the doctor gives
me the O.K., I'll be able to fight with you guys again... finally.
By the way, I have a favor to ask. You've been doing a great job
leading the team in Tartarus... Would you mind continuing after I come
back? That way, I can concentrate on building my strength.
MAIN: 
AKIHIKO: ...You'll be fine. Just keep doing what you've been doing.
AKIHIKO: I already talked to Mitsuru, and she was okay with it too. Good luck.
[Main and Akihiko enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===


=== AFTER SCHOOL ===


=== EVENING ===

[Main, Yukari, Junpei, and Akihiko are at the table in the dorm lounge.]
YUKARI: Senpai, I hear you're fully healed!
JUNPEI: Congrats, man!
AKIHIKO: I need to catch up on my training. I've slacked off for a whole month.
YUKARI: Shouldn't you take it easy, though? You don't wanna reinjure your arm.
AKIHIKO: I've already wasted precious time. Besides, we found another
Persona-user.
JUNPEI: We did!? Sweet! Is it a girl...?
AKIHIKO: Actually, it is. She's a junior who goes to our school. Fuuka
Yamagishi... Do you guys know her?
YUKARI: Yamagishi...? Oh, that girl in 2-E... She gets sick a lot, from what I
heard... I don't see her at school very often.
AKIHIKO: She was at the same hospital as me. That's how we found out about her.
But, maybe she's not cut out for battle. I had an Evoker made for her,
too...
JUNPEI: What!? We're giving up on her already!? I was gonna offer her some
private lessons...
YUKARI: ......
JUNPEI: Wh-Why're you lookin' at me like that? ...... C'mon... I'm a guy.
Whaddya expect!?

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Yukari there.]
YUKARI: Mornin'. You're as punctual as always, Main-kun. Junpei looks like the
world is about to end.
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Yeah, really. Exam scores will be posted today, so... that
explains it.
YUKARI: Well, exam scores will be posted today, so...
YUKARI: He said he's gonna beg for a higher score... Like that's gonna work.
Oh, by the way... You remember how Akihiko-senpai was talking about
that girl Fuuka...? I hear she's kinda weak... but that's just a rumor.
I wonder what she's really like. Either way, having another
Persona-user can't be a bad thing!
[Main and Yukari enter the school.]

=== LUNCHTIME ===

STUDENT: Hey, the results are posted!
respect! Your Charm has increased. You suddenly remember something.
Mitsuru promised to give you a gift if you scored the highest.

=== AFTERNOON ===

[Ms. Toriumi is teaching Composition.]
MS. TORIUMI: All right class, settle down. You can show your scores to one
another later. Let's go over the test now. The first part was the
kanji dictation section... This passage had some very easy kanji.
I'm embarrassed that some of you got them wrong... The next
portion was the short essay, reacting to a passage about bullying
in schools. This one was a gimme. As long as you wrote something
down, I gave you credit for it... You could have complained about
the bullying at Gekkoukan, right? ...I'm kidding, of course.
There's no bullying here... None whatsoever. I'm not getting into
that.
MAIN: 
MS. TORIUMI: Okay, on to the next section. Many of you got this part
wrong. Now, pay attention. You were asked to write the
correct conjunction in each case... But the answer to
every single one was "and." Do you understand?

now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Junpei there.]
JUNPEI: S'uuup, dude? Hey, how'd you do on the exams...?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Seriously...?
JUNPEI: Seriously? But, your scores have to be higher than mine...
JUNPEI: Man, I'm a laughing stock... After the results were posted, I heard
these two cute girls talking... They were sayin' I have a one-track
mind... Well, I won't let it get to me! We might be getting another
girl on our team anyways!
[Main and Junpei enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

AKIHIKO: ...Where have you been? Hey, let's go to Tartarus later. I need to get
back into the swing of things. I can't leave all the fun to you guys.

=== LUNCHTIME ===

[Main is sitting in class. Ms. Toriumi approaches him.]
MS. TORIUMI: Main, I have a big favor to ask of you... It's about our athletic
teams... Participation is down. The coach says he needs more
people... Since you're not on any team, Main, you must have time
on your hands, right? Between track, kendo, and swimming, there's
got to be one that interests you, right? Please! Join something!
without saying yes.
MAIN: 
MS. TORIUMI: Really!? You'll do it!? Thank you! Yes! A free lunch!
...Oh, um, disregard that last part. Then, can you go see
the team after school and tell them you want to join?
head for the practice field.
MS. TORIUMI: Really!? You'll do it!? Thank you! Yes! A free lunch!
...Oh, um, disregard that last part. Then, can you go see
the team after school and tell them you want to join?
head for the gym.
MS. TORIUMI: Really!? You'll do it!? Thank you! Yes! A free lunch!
...Oh, um, disregard that last part. Then, can you go see
the team after school and tell them you want to join?
head for the pool.
MS. TORIUMI: I'm sorry, what were you saying...?

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

(If you were forced to join a sports team, you'll see the Rank 1 Scene of the
Chariot Arcana now.)

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Junpei there.]
JUNPEI: S'up, dude? So, whaddya think...?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: About Fuuka Yamagishi, of course. I haven't given up hope that
she'll join our team. Dude, her face looks so familiar.
JUNPEI: How can I be calm when another chick might be coming to our
dorm!? Fuuka Yamagishi... I know I've seen her before.
JUNPEI: She does look kinda weak, but it only makes me wanna protect her,
ya know?
[Main and Junpei enter the school.]

=== AFTERNOON ===

[Mr. Edogawa is teaching Miscellaneous.]
MR. EDOGAWA: I'm Edogawa, in charge of integrative learning. Eeeheehee... In
this class, I'll ease all your worries. It's psychotherapy through
magic! All right, everyone, be very, very quiet. No talking...
Silence! Were you surprised to hear me bring up magic? It's a
recent proposal, so it's not well-known yet... Here it is: Those
who believe will be saved. Study hard, and I can beat your weak
minds into shape! Eeeheehee... Now then! Let's get on with our
first lecture, on the basics of magic. Who can use magic, and who
cannot? That'll be our starting point. Some of you might think
that magic lets you do absolutely anything... Pulling pranks on
people, hurting your enemies... If that's what you think, then
you'll never learn magic. It's true of both eastern and western
sorcery... Those with wicked hearts will either be powerless, or
will be driven to ruin. There's one more thing that can't be
forgotten when learning magic. That is... a "master." You should
aspire to become as good as your predecessors, especially if
you're studying difficult magic. If you don't have a master,
learning the black arts will be impossible. When you begin your
training, you'll have to live in two worlds at once: the real
world, and the dark realm. If you can't distinguish between the
two, you're headed for certain disaster. That's why the presence
of a master is of the utmost importance! With that in mind, I'll
move on to meditation, a standard practice in magical training.
I've got some prints for you...
MAIN: 
MR. EDOGAWA: ...Now then, it looks like it's time. If you're interested
in the subject, try meditating before going to bed. Slowly
recall the events of the day... It's like traveling back
through time. If you can do that flawlessly, you may just
make a good magician. Eeeheehee... That's all for today!

[Main puts his head down.]
eyes... You start to feel better... Your condition is
now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===

MITSURU: Welcome back. Hm, that's strange... The number of victims seems to be
on the rise again... Apparently, the decline was only temporary.
YUKARI: Huh? Does that mean that no matter how many Shadows we defeat, more
will just keep coming? If that's the case, then what's the point of
fighting...?
MITSURU: If we do nothing, then everyone will eventually join The Lost. Our
efforts have prevented the crisis from escalating.
YUKARI: I guess you're right. ...Ya know, it's kinda creepy when you think
about it... If we couldn't use our Personas, then the whole city would
be crawling with zombies...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
LISTENING STUDENT: I heard from a younger guy in my club yesterday that the
10th-graders are teasing someone.
GOSSIPING STUDENT: What, like bullying him? Poor kid... What's his name?
LISTENING STUDENT: I don't know... All I heard is that it's really a problem.
I thought our school was peaceful, too, but I guess it's
not so much.
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Yukari is walking through the school when she overhears two girls laughing.]
FEMALE VOICES: Hahahahaha!
BRUNETTE: So, I pretended to take a picture with my cell phone.
Brunette's Friend: And?
BRUNETTE: She freaked out and started crying. ...Like it was the end of the
world. You should've seen the look on her face... It was priceless.
Brunette's Friend: Oh my gawd!
BRUNETTE: I've never laughed so hard in all my life!
GOSSIPING GIRLS: Hahahahaha!
YUKARI: They're making fun of someone...? Don't they have anything better to
do?
[Yukari begins to walk away, but the girls resume talking.]
Brunette's Friend: Huh...? Where's that voice coming from...?
BRUNETTE: What voice? I don't hear anything.
Brunette's Friend: ......
BRUNETTE: What's wrong, Maki? Maki!
Brunette's Friend: ......Huh?
BRUNETTE: Are you okay!?
Brunette's Friend: Sorry... What were we talking about?
YUKARI: I can't stand girls like that...
[Yukari walks off.]

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Hey, did you hear? That 11th-grader...
LISTENING STUDENT: Oh, yeah! The one who was lying on the ground this morning,
right? I hope she just ran away from home... But I feel like
this is the start of something big.
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Yeah... There might be reporters and camera crews and stuff.
I don't want to deal with it.
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Main and Junpei are in homeroom. Some girls nearby are talking.]
STUDENT: Did you hear? About that girl in 2-E...?
CLASSMATE: Yeah, they haven't got a clue...
STUDENT: Isn't that bizarre!?
JUNPEI: Man, can you believe these people...? So, did you hear the details?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Stop acting like you don't care. You really should hear this...
JUNPEI: Well, a girl from 2-E went missing last night. This morning, they found
her lying on the ground in front of the school gate! Nobody knows what
happened, and supposedly, she's still unconscious.
[Yukari walks over to Main and Junpei.]
JUNPEI: Yo, Yuka-tan. This is a tough case, even for Junpei Iori, Ace
Detective.
YUKARI: Ace Detective? ...Are you stupid or something? ...... More more like
Stupei, Ace Defective.
JUNPEI: Hey! I resent that. Anyway, where've you been?
YUKARI: I was talking to the teacher. That girl they found... I saw her
yesterday, on my way back from practice. She seemed okay then...
JUNPEI: Whoa... Now, that's really strange.

=== EVENING ===

YUKARI: ...Oh, hey. Did you hear the rumor going around school? People can be
so immature, sometimes. I mean, it's just a ghost story. Anyway, I'm
not feeling very well, so I won't be able to go to Tartarus tonight.
...Sorry. I'l prolly just watch a little TV and then go to bed early.

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Mitsuru there.]
MITSURU: Good morning. ...There seems to be a sense of restlessness in the air.
MAIN: 
MITSURU: You don't feel it...? Well, I just hope it doesn't have
anything to do with Shadows.
MITSURU: Well, I just hope it doesn't have anything to do with Shadows.
MITSURU: Akihiko said we may be receiving a new member, but we don't know when
we'll be attacked... So remain alert at all times.
[Main and Mitsuru enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

[Everyone is gathered around the table in the dorm lounge.]
JUNPEI: Hey Yuka-tan, have you seen the posts on the student message board?
You know how last week, that girl was found by the front gate? Well,
there's this rumor that it was an angry spirit from this one ghost
story.
YUKARI: H-Hey! C'mon... Nobody believes that stuff!? ...R-Right?
MITSURU: So, what is this ghost story about?
YUKARI: Wha--!? It-It's probably made-up... so why bother!?
AKIHIKO: I'm interested. Go ahead and tell us.
YUKARI: Uh...
[The camera zooms in a little on Junpei, the lights go out and Junpei holds a
flashlight up to his face.]
JUNPEI: Good evening. Welcome to "Junpei's Believe It, or Don't." ...There are
many strange things in this world... According to one story... if you
get caught at school late at night, you'll be devoured by a maniacal
ghost that roams the halls! The other day, this friend of mine--let's
call him Shu... He said to me, "Junpei, I saw something strange." He
sounded serious, so I asked him what he'd seen. He said it was about
the girl in 2-E... He claims he saw her go into the school on the night
of the incident. I couldn't believe it. She's not the kind of girl to
be out at night... But Shu was as white as a sheet. He insisted it was
true... Then, it hit me... That ghost must've tried to make her its
dinner! And that's why they found her lying on the ground by the gate!
I felt a chill run down my spine, and I broke into a cold sweat... Yes,
there are strange things in this world... Believe it... or don't.
[The lights come back on and Junpei puts away the flashlight.]
MITSURU: ...What do you think, Akihiko?
AKIHIKO: I think it's worth investigating.
JUNPEI: Wow, I didn't know you were afraid of ghosts, Yuka-tan. That's kinda
funny.
YUKARI: Hey, watch it! ...F-Fine, then let's investigate. We'll each ask around
for the rest of the week. I'll prove to you that this ghost story is
just an urban legend!
MITSURU: I appreciate that. The story is a bit unnerving.
AKIHIKO: Then, I'll let you guys handle it. Just make sure you sleep with one
eye open...

=== DARK HOUR ===

MYSTERIOUS BOY: Good evening.
[Main is in his bed; the boy is sitting on the edge.]
MYSTERIOUS BOY: I came to see you again, as I promised. How are you?
MAIN: 
MYSTERIOUS BOY: I'm glad you remembered me.
MYSTERIOUS BOY: That isn't very nice; show a little courtesy.
MYSTERIOUS BOY: Now... In another week, the moon will be full again. And the
next ordeal will be upon you. So, be careful.
[The boy disappears and reappears at the foot of the bed.]
MYSTERIOUS BOY: ...I'll come again.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Yukari there.]
YUKARI: Mornin'. Ya know what...? From this day forward, I'm gonna do my best!
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Duh! The ghost story! Did you already forget what we talked
about last night?
YUKARI: Do you even know what I'm talking about?
YUKARI: ...You're hopeless. You better find out as much as you can, too...
Remember, you only have until Friday! I'm counting on you, Main-kun.
[Main and Yukari enter the School.]

=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Ekoda is teaching Classic Literature.]
MR. EKODA: Ah... This phrase "mono susamajiku" also occurs in "Ugetsu
Monogatari." Of the "Ugetsu Monogatari" stories, I'm particularly
fond of the one about the ghostly wife. Such an eerie, yet poignant
story... Speaking of which, I know a good ghost story. Would you
like to hear?
MAIN: 
MR. EKODA: ...Then his friend, who entered the tunnel with him,
suddenly began to scream... "There's a girl right behind
you!" Frightened, they ran back home. But he started to hear
scratching noises each night... And a faint voice, saying...
"Let me in... Let me in..." But as far as he knew, the room
adjacent to his was vacant. One night, he decided to knock
on the wall where the sounds were emanating. Hmhmhm...
Right next to his ear, the voice came loud and clear...
"I'm here!" That's how he got a new family member, and they
lived happily ever after. That's all for today!
increased.
[Main puts his head down.]
eyes... You start to feel better... Your condition is
now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? Yo, let's go to Tartarus tonight, man. The Lost are
everywhere, and it seems like it's only getting worse... Plus, there's
those freakin' rumors goin' around school... We need to let off some
steam.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Junpei there.]
JUNPEI: S'up, dude? Hey, are you looking into that ghost story?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Seriously? Shouldn't we just leave that to Yuka-tan? I've got
better things to do...
JUNPEI: I know you're lying, man. As for me, I've got better things to
do... I say just leave it to Yuka-tan.
JUNPEI: Besides, I have plenty of scary stories up my sleeve. I bet you pissed
your pants when you heard that story the other night. They say it's
true, though.
[Main and Junpei enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Yukari there.]
YUKARI: Mornin'...  This sucks... I spent so much time thinking about
ghost stories that now I'm having nightmares...
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Mm... It's going.
YUKARI: Don't worry. I'm fine.
YUKARI: But, there's so many stupid rumors going around that it's tough to put
them all together.I did get some useful information, though. I'm gonna
look into it more today.
[Main and Yukari enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Yukari there.]
YUKARI: Hey, remember what we talked about on Monday? ...The ghost story? Let's
talk about it some more tonight...
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Yep, I heard some interesting stories... Don't forget, okay?
YUKARI: Hey! No ditching! I heard some interesting stories, so make
sure you're there, okay?
[Main and Yukari enter the school.]

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Main, Yukari, and Junpei are in their homeroom.]
YUKARI: ...Well, today's Friday. Did you two ask around, like we said?
JUNPEI: Huh? We had something planned for today?
[Yukari glares at him.]
JUNPEI: I know, I know! I'm just kidding! Man, you have such a short temper...
YUKARI: Then, we'll meet in the lounge after school. Don't forget!
JUNPEI: Yes, Ma'am...

=== EVENING ===

[Main, Yukari, and Junpei are in the dorm lounge.]
YUKARI: Okay, as we agreed on Monday, we'll now hold a meeting to discuss what
we learned.
JUNPEI: Wow, you're really into this.
YUKARI: Of course. I got lots of good info. It turns out no angry ghost was
involved.
JUNPEI: Oh, so that's what's important, huh?
YUKARI: Hmph. First off, let's talk about how this rumor got started... Since
the girl was found on school grounds, there's at least one similarity
to the ghost story. But, why did the rumor spread so fast, if this was
the first time anything happened?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Correct!
YUKARI: Dying message? Um, the victim isn't dead...
YUKARI: Please... Let it go.
YUKARI: But yeah, I was surprised when I found out the reason... Over the next
few days, there were two more similar incidents. All three victims had
to be hospitalized. No wonder people were talking. Next. The victims
are in different classes, and they don't seem to be connected. However,
they did have one thing in common. What was it?
JUNPEI: What is this, a quiz show?  Do YOU know?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Ate out a lot...? Are you crazy? What's that got to do with
anything?
JUNPEI: Well, some families never eat out.
YUKARI: You be quiet! They hung out together, not ate out a lot!
YUKARI: Yup, that's right!
YUKARI: HELLO... we already KNOW that. They hung out together,
dummy.
YUKARI: Not just once or twice, either. They got in with a bad crowd, and were
always out late. It can't be just a coincidence... So, to find out what
happened, we're gonna do some field research.
JUNPEI: Field research? Are you kidding?
YUKARI: Yeah, there's this one place where the three victims were regulars.
JUNPEI: Wait, you're not talkin' about that place behind Port Island Station,
are you...?
YUKARI: Oh, you're familiar with it?
JUNPEI: You can't go there! I've heard some nasty rumors about that place!
YUKARI: Is that so? Well then, we should all go together.  You'll
come, right?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Thanks!
YUKARI: Aw, come on! Junpei's just exaggerating.
YUKARI: I'll take that as a yes.
JUNPEI: Forget it... That place is bad news. I mean, don't you think we're
getting in over our heads?
YUKARI: Up until now, all we've done is take orders. Does that feel right to
you?
JUNPEI: I know what you mean, but... Man, did you have to say it like that?
I guess I don't have a choice, do I?
YUKARI: Okay, we'll go tomorrow night, then.

=== EARLY MORNING ===


=== EVENING ===

[Main, Yukari, and Junpei are about to leave the dorm.]
YUKARI: ...Alright, let's get going.
JUNPEI: What's your hurry? ...I still think this is a bad idea. How could you
be afraid of ghosts, but not be scared of this...?
YUKARI: It's easy to get freaked out by something you can't see, don'tcha
think?
JUNPEI: Actually, I'm more worried about things I CAN see... like bats and
knives!
YUKARI: Big deal, so it's a little "dangerous"... Come on, it'll be
an adventure!
[Yukari opens the doors and walks out.]
JUNPEI: More like a suicide mission.
[Main and Junpei follow her out. Later the three of them enter the area behind
Port Island Station. A group of thugs is hanging out there.]
PUNK: ...The hell?
Punk's Buddy: Check out those rags... They're from Gekko High.
JUNPEI: Oh man, this is worse than I thought...
[The party approaches the two punks.]
PUNK: Hey, you, I think you're in the wrong place.
JUNPEI: Uh... Well, I...
PUNK: You don't belong here... Get it? Beat it, Goatee...
JUNPEI: G-Goatee? Oh, y-you mean me...
YUKARI: We don't need your permission to be here.
JUNPEI: H-Hey! Are you nuts!? Take a look around you!
YUKARI: I'm not blind, ya know. Come on, don't be intimidated by these scum!
PUNK: What was that?
TOUGH CHICK: She just called us "scum."
Tough Chick's Friend: Let's get 'em. Who cares where they're from!?
TOUGH CHICK: We'll post some pictures that will make her daddy cry! She'll wish
she was never born!
GIRLS: Hahahahaha! Oh, that's so clever! Hahahahahahaha!!
YUKARI: These guys are the worst...
PUNK: You oughta learn to shut that trap of yours. Man, I feel sorry for you,
Goatee. This bitch is a pain in the ass... huh!!
[The punk punches Junpei in the stomach and he crouches down in pain.]
JUNPEI: Ugh!
YUKARI: Junpei...!
[The other punks close in on the party.]
PUNK: Hey, pretty boy! I don't like your face either... Got anything to say
before I beat it to a bloody pulp!?
[The punks begin laughing.]
FAMILIAR VOICE: That's enough.
[The guy from Akihiko's hospital room walks in.]
GUY FROM THE OTHER DAY: They didn't know what they were getting into. I'll make
sure they leave. Alright?
PUNK: Who do you think you are, dumbass? You want some too!?
GUY FROM THE OTHER DAY: Do I have a choice?
PUNK: That's it, you're goin' down!!
[The punk charges at the guy, but he headbutts the punk and he falls down.]
PUNK: Shit...
Punk's Buddy: Damn you, Shinjiro... That's right... You're from Gekko High too,
aren't ya!? I thought you were one of us...
SHINJIRO: What gave you that idea? I don't remember swearing a blood
oath.
[The punk gets back up.]
PUNK: You son of a bitch! You just crossed the line! You think you're going
home alive!?
SHINJIRO: Sure do. ...Wanna give it a try?
PUNK: Uh... S-Screw this...
GIRLS: Hahahahaha! What a loser!
Punk's Buddy: You better grow eyes in the back of your head!
[All the thugs leave and Junpei stands back up.]
JUNPEI: Oh man, Senpai, that was awesome!
SHINJIRO: You idiots! Get outta here. This place isn't for you.
[Shinjiro begins to walk away.]
YUKARI: Wait! We came here for a reason!
SHINJIRO: You guys... You were at the hospital.
[He walks over to them.]
SHINJIRO: Did Aki tell you to come here?
MAIN: 
SHINJIRO: Stupid move...
SHINJIRO: ...Hmph.
SHINJIRO: What do you wanna know? About that ghost story?
YUKARI: Um, yeah... How'd you know?
[They move over to the stairs and Shinjiro sits down.]
SHINJIRO: It's a rumor. Those girls who wound up in the hospital were
here talkin' shit every night... about all the things they'd
done to some girl named Fuuka.
JUNPEI: Fuuka...? You mean Fuuka Yamagishi, from 2-E? They were picking on her?
SHINJIRO: That's why people are saying it's Fuuka's spirit that did it.
I hear it's all over the net, too.
YUKARI: Fuuka's spirit...? Wait, what do you mean by that!?
SHINJIRO You guys don't know? This Fuuka girl might be dead. She
hasn't been home in over a week. Don't you guys go to
school!? How do you not know this?
JUNPEI: Are you serious!? I thought she was out sick... But, she's missing!?
YUKARI: So much for the ghost story. Mr. Ekoda is the homeroom teacher for 2-E,
right? Does he know about this...?
[Shinjiro stands up.]
SHINJIRO: I get it, Aki... Still trying to make up for the past. It's
you who can't let go...
[The party looks confused.]
SHINJIRO: Nothing... That's all I know... Satisfied?
[Junpei gives him a bow.]
JUNPEI: Y-Yeah! Thanks, Senpai!  ...C'mon, show some appreciation.
[Main and Yukari bow too.]
YUKARI: Thanks! You totally helped us out! ...You're very kind.
SHINJIRO: Huh?
YUKARI: I, um... Never mind.
SHINJIRO: Tch... Don't come here again.
[He walks off. The party returns to the dorm.]

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

ask the teacher about the missing girl, Fuuka Yamagishi, today...

=== LUNCHTIME ===

[Main, Yukari, and Junpei enter the Faculty office. Mitsuru, Mr. Ekoda, and one
of the bullies that Yukari saw before are already there.]
YUKARI: Oh, Mitsuru-senpai. Why are you here?
MITSURU: Same reason as you. Mr. Ekoda, I'm here to ask you about a student
named Fuuka Yamagishi...
BRUNETTE: No!! I-I never thought it'd turn out like this... Fuuka...
YUKARI: Wait... You're that girl...
MITSURU: What did you do to Yamagishi?
MR. EKODA: Hold on, Mitsuru... This isn't an interrogation. Natsuki, you don't
have to say anything if you don't want to. You wouldn't want to give
her the wrong idea.
NATSUKI MORIYAMA: Fuuka... She... She always looked so frazzled whenever I gave
her a hard time... Then, I realized... She's an honor
student, but deep inside, she's the same as us. I knew
exactly which buttons to push. We were just messin' with her
that day, too! May 29th... We took Fuuka to the gym... and
locked the door from the outside...
JUNPEI: What!? You locked her in!?
NATSUKI MORIYAMA: That night, Maki returned to school alone. She was afraid
we'd get in trouble if Fuuka committed suicide. But, she
never came back... and the next morning...
YUKARI: ...she was found lying on the ground by the gate.
NATSUKI MORIYAMA: I went to the gym to let Fuuka out, but the door was still
locked... So, I opened it and went inside, but she wasn't
there... We all freaked out. Starting that night, we all went
looking for her. But every night, another one of us went
missing... and they each ended up like Maki!
MITSURU: I see... By the way, Mr. Ekoda... All this time, you've attributed
Yamagishi's absences to "illness." But in reality, she was missing.
You must have been aware of that... What was your intention?
MR. EKODA: I was thinking of the students, of course. You children may not
understand, but we have to consider the future of everyone affected.
MITSURU: You mean, you chose not to report this to the police for the "good of
the class."
MR. EKODA: It, it was in her best interest. I wouldn't want her records to be
stained by something like this. Her parents agree!
MITSURU: So to protect your career, you ignored your responsibility as a
teacher... How despicable...!
MR. EKODA: I-I didn't... I was just...
MITSURU: About your friends... Did you notice anything unusual
before the incidents? ...Anything at all.
NATSUKI MORIYAMA: ...... They all heard a voice... A creepy voice. ...Right
before each of them went missing. They said it was calling
their name.
JUNPEI: Oh, man...
YUKARI: Senpai, could it be...!?
[Mitsuru moves over to the party.]
MITSURU: It's them... no doubt about it. Until now, there was no way of knowing
how or why some people are conscious during the Dark Hour... But, it's
the voice; it draws them in. It's not a random phenomenon. This whole
thing has made me realize... They're clearly targeting humans. Shadows
are the enemy of mankind.  Stay at our dorm tonight; it's
the safest place.
[Natsuki nods.]
MITSURU: If you hear the voice, tell us immediately. And don't leave the room,
no matter what. If you can do that much, you should be okay. ...Don't
worry, Yamagishi should be alright as well.  We'll meet
after school in the Student Council Room to discuss tonight's
operation.
JUNPEI: T-Tonight!?
MITSURU: We're going to rescue Yamagishi. If my guess is right, she's still
inside the school.

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Everyone is in the Student Council Room. Yukari locks the door.]
YUKARI: All set.
MITSURU: Tonight, we will infiltrate the campus. Our objective is to rescue
Fuuka Yamagishi.
JUNPEI: Um, I don't get it... Is Fuuka inside the school somewhere?
YUKARI: And why at night? At midnight, this place turns into--
MITSURU: Exactly. That's how Yamagishi wandered into Tartarus.
YUKARI: Then, ever since Fuuka got locked in the gym, she's been stuck
there...?
[Mitsuru nods.]
JUNPEI: But, that was ten days ago! That means...
AKIHIKO: Not necessarily. We can't jump to conclusions. Tartarus only appears
during the Dark Hour. So, what about the rest of the day?
YUKARI: Now that you mention it...
AKIHIKO: This is only a theory, but I think time may function differently with
respect to Tartarus. So, even though it's been ten days for us,
perhaps only ten hours have passed for her. It's possible she's still
alive.
JUNPEI: Wow, ya think so!? Uh, but the Dark Hour is pretty brutal... We can
barely handle an hour; how's she gonna last ten!?
YUKARI: That's true... And, even if she's still alive, we might not be able to
get to her...
AKIHIKO: Are you just gonna let her die, then!? ...I have an idea. Let's try to
enter Tartarus exactly how Fuuka did. We'll go to the gym, and wait
for midnight. That's the quickest way.
YUKARI: Is that really gonna work...?
MITSURU: Honestly, I have reservations. If something goes wrong, you could all
end up lost in Tartarus too. But...
AKIHIKO: I won't stand by and do nothing if there's a chance we can save her...
I'd never forgive myself. If you guys don't want to go, then I'll go
by myself.
YUKARI: Senpai...?
MITSURU: ...Alright. We're aware of the risks, but we can't just leave her
there.
YUKARI: I agree. And we won't know until we try.
JUNPEI: Cool, we get to sneak into the school! Heheh... In that case, I know
just what to do...

=== EVENING ===

[Everyone has gathered in the meeting room at the dorm.]
MITSURU: Hmm...
AKIHIKO: What's wrong?
MITSURU: I can't get a hold of the Chairman.
YUKARI: I guess we can handle it ourselves.
MITSURU: There's one problem, though. Without the Chairman's help, I'm not sure
how we can get inside the school...
JUNPEI: No need to worry. I've got it all set to go.
MITSURU: Set to go...? An explosive?  Alright, I'll let you handle
this.
AKIHIKO: We don't have time to waste. Let's go.
[Mitsuru and Akihiko leave.]
YUKARI: ...An explosive? For real?
JUNPEI: ...Nah... All I did was unlock a door...
[Later, the group is inside a hallway in the school.]
JUNPEI: See? We got in no problem. Man, I'm a genius!
YUKARI: Is that really something to brag about?
MITSURU: So, you unlocked it earlier... Tres bien!
AKIHIKO: No time for compliments. Let's go.
[Mitsuru and Akihiko walk off.]
YUKARI: What's the big deal, anyway...?
JUNPEI: Tray Ben...? What's that mean? That's not English, is it?
[The group moves to one of the classrooms.]
YUKARI: Can we turn on the lights...?
JUNPEI: Aww, you scared?
YUKARI: No! ...Stupei.
JUNPEI: Stop callin' me that!
AKIHIKO: Quiet. It's better if we leave 'em off. They cut the power at night
anyway.
YUKARI: I don't like sneaking around...
MITSURU: First, we have to find the key to the gym. Akihiko and I will check
the janitor's room. You three check the Faculty Office. After that,
we'll meet in the main hallway. Got it?
JUNPEI: The Faculty Office, huh...? Hey, maybe we'll find some test questions!
Heheh...
AKIHIKO: Maybe I should go to the Faculty Office, too... It sounds interesting.
MITSURU: Are you planning something unscrupulous under my supervision? If so,
then expect to be severely punished...
JUNPEI: It-It was a joke! I'd never do something like that! Ha, haha...
AKIHIKO: Come on, Mitsuru... Lighten up a little.
MITSURU: Fine. Let's head over to the janitor's room. Iori, you're coming with
us.
[Mitsuru leaves; Akihiko and Junpei hesitate before following her out.]
YUKARI: Alright, let's get this over with.
[Main and Yukari exit the classroom and go downstairs to the lobby. They hear
what sounds like footsteps.]
YUKARI: Do you hear that?
YUKARI: Th-There's someone else here...?
[Main and Yukari hide behind a pillar. A flashlight beam scans the area they
were standing earlier for a few seconds before turning away.]
YUKARI: It's just a security guard...
MAIN: 
YUKARI: I know...
YUKARI: No, I'm not! I'm just a little nervous, that's all! Do you
blame me? I mean, we did break into the school in the middle of
the night. Wait a minute... That could've been one of the
others. Haha, there's nothing to be afraid of, right? Hahaha...
Why am I laughing?
YUKARI: Um, of course not. We already know it's not a ghost. And
besides, I'm not THAT afraid of--
[Yukari's cell phone ringer goes off.]
YUKARI: Ahhh! M-My cell phone!? Why now!?
[She checks her phone.]
YUKARI: Figures... It's spam.  Sorry about that. It took me by surprise!
MAIN: 
YUKARI: See?
YUKARI: ...... Whatever.
YUKARI: H-Huh!? ...It's not funny.
[Main and Yukari continue on to the Faculty Office. Yukari tries to check the
keys.]
YUKARI: No... No... It's so dark, I can barely read these.
[She holds up a key to Main.]
YUKARI: What does it say on this one?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Really? Let me see! ...Yeah, this is it! Mind if we borrow
this...?
YUKARI: Are you sure? It looks shorter than that. ...Hey, it says
"Gym"! Mind if we borrow this...?
YUKARI: What, are you trying to scare me or something? ...Trust me,
you'll pay for that. Wait a minute... This is the key for the
gym!
YUKARI: Okay, let's go. We're supposed to meet them in the main hallway.
[The party regroups in the lobby.]
MITSURU: Did you find the key?
YUKARI: Sure did.
JUNPEI: Ya know, I heard a scream that sounded kinda familiar...
[Yukari blushes and looks away.]
JUNPEI: What, you actually did? I was just kidding...
YUKARI: You wanna make somethin' of it!?
AKIHIKO: Keep it down.
MITSURU: We'll divide into teams again. Three of you will enter Tartarus, and
one of you will remain outside with me. Once the Dark Hour has begun,
I'll determine Yamagishi's position.
AKIHIKO: I'll go.  You should come, too. You can take the lead, like
always.
YUKARI: Um, then, I'll be the third--
JUNPEI: Wait a second...! Remember how I accidentally screwed up on the
monorail? Gimme a chance to make up for that!
YUKARI: Oh, come on! It's not always about YOU! Besides, you didn't
"accidentally" screw up.
AKIHIKO: Alright, Junpei, we'll give you another shot.
JUNPEI: Sweet! Thanks!
AKIHIKO: What's wrong, Yukari? You don't want to stay behind with Mitsuru?
YUKARI: Um, n-no, it's fine.
MITSURU: It's almost time.

=== DARK HOUR ===

[Natsuki is sitting on a bed back at the dorm.]
NATSUKI MORIYAMA: I...  ...I'm all alone, after all... Fuuka... Hm...?
[Natsuki puts her hands to her ears.]
NATSUKI MORIYAMA: No... No! I don't wanna hear this!
[She suddenly looks up.]
NATSUKI MORIYAMA: ...calling me...
[She stands up.]
NATSUKI MORIYAMA: I... I have to go... tell her I'm sorry... Fuuka...
[Meanwhile, Mitsuru and Yukari are in the Tartarus lobby. Mitsuru is messing
with a device on her bike.]
YUKARI: Umm...
MITSURU: We still haven't heard back from them... The transceiver's sensitivity
is set to high, too...
YUKARI: ...O-Oh yeah, that girl, Natsuki... I hope she's okay at the dorm...
MITSURU: Unfortunately, no place is completely safe in the Dark Hour. But, we
couldn't possibly bring her here, and one of us staying behind was out
of the question.
YUKARI: Yeah... I guess so...
MITSURU: ......
YUKARI: ...But, we're all here for Fuuka's sake--
AKIHIKO: Mitsuru, can you hear me?
MITSURU: This is Mitsuru. I've confirmed your position. You're higher up than
I expected... You're barely in communication range. Is everyone
alright?
AKIHIKO: ...don't know... got separ...
MITSURU: Akihiko! Come in, Akihiko!
YUKARI: ...Is he out of range? I'm starting to get worried...
[Somewhere in Tartarus, Main gets up from the floor.]
MYSTERIOUS BOY: Are you awake?
[The Mysterious Boy appears behind Main.]
MYSTERIOUS BOY: This is the first time we've spoken outside of your room.
MAIN: 
MYSTERIOUS BOY: Don't worry, you'll see them soon.
MYSTERIOUS BOY: I told you, remember? I'm always with you.
MYSTERIOUS BOY: But, we don't have much time to talk. Tonight, there is more
than one ordeal you must face... You should hurry... She's
waiting for you. You guys will need her. Okay, then... I hope
we can speak again.
[He vanishes.]
MITSURU: Are... you... alri--? ...distance... too far.
...can't provi-- ...back up. ...... You got s-- ...from Akihi-- ......
[Main moves towards the stairs.]
MITSURU: ...Akihiko and... aren't... this floor...
MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Who's there...? ...Are you human?
[Main moves on to the next floor.]
MITSURU: What's y-- ...current loca-- ...Reply immed--
MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Where am I...? Why am I here...? Please answer me...
[Main moves towards the stairs.]
MITSURU: Can y-- ...hear me? ...Please ans--
MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Is someone there...? Please answer me...
[Main goes up another floor and find Junpei and Akihiko.]
JUNPEI: Hey, here he is! Man, we were worried about you.
AKIHIKO: I don't think we should enter Tartarus this way again...
JUNPEI: Oh yeah! Did you hear a voice while you were in here? Uh, kinda like--
MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Who is this...? Are you human?
JUNPEI: Th-That's it! That's the voice! It sounded like it came from behind
us...
[They look behind them. A young girl pops her head out from behind the corner.]
AKIHIKO: Are you Fuuka Yamagishi?
[The girl runs over to them.]
JUNPEI: Wow, you're alive! That's awesome! Never fear, Junpei's here!
AKIHIKO: I'm glad you're okay... Come with us.
FUUKA YAMAGISHI: Thank you so much... I...
AKIHIKO: Looks like we made the right decision. I'll see if I can contact
Mitsuru.
FUUKA YAMAGISHI: Where are we...? I was at school, and then...
JUNPEI: Well... It's a long story. I'll explain after we get outta here.
[Akihiko tries to use his transceiver.]
AKIHIKO: Mitsuru, can you hear me? ...... No good. All I hear is static.
JUNPEI: Oh yeah, are ya hurt? Have you run into any monsters?
FUUKA: So, there ARE strange creatures in here, then... I've managed to avoid
them so far...
AKIHIKO: Are you serious!? How's that possible!?
FUUKA: Umm, it's hard to describe, but... I can sort of tell where they are...
JUNPEI: Whaddya mean? Are you psychic?
AKIHIKO: She has the same power as Mitsuru... Maybe even stronger... since
Mitsuru's Persona is more battle-oriented.  Hang on to this.
[Akihiko gives her an Evoker.]
FUUKA: B-But, this is...!
AKIHIKO: Think of it as a lucky charm. It's not really a gun. Alright, let's
get outta here!
[The group begins looking for an exit. As they pass a window, Junpei stops.]
JUNPEI: Whoa, check out the moon! ...I've never seen it so bright.
AKIHIKO: Some research indicates that the Shadows are affected by the phases
of the moon. Of course, the same can be said for humans.
JUNPEI: That would explain Yuka-tan's mood swings. Hey, wasn't it a full moon
the night we went to the monorail?
AKIHIKO: Was it?
JUNPEI: I think so... Why?
AKIHIKO: Hey, did you see the moon on the night the dorm was
attacked, back in April?
MAIN: 
AKIHIKO: Today is the 8th... The monorail incident happened last month
around the same time... and the assault on the dorm was a
month before that! ...They were all during a full moon!
[Akihiko tries to use the transciever again.]
AKIHIKO: Mitsuru, are you there!?
MITSURU: Akihiko...? ...Shadows--
AKIHIKO: Hey, can you hear me? Mitsuru, come in!
MITSURU: ...Be careful...
AKIHIKO: Mitsuru!? Mitsuru!!
FUUKA: ...What is this thing...? It's much bigger than the others... and it's
attacking someone...
AKIHIKO: Dammit!!
JUNPEI: Wh-What's going on!?
AKIHIKO: It's one of THEM! If my guess is right, they come every full moon!
...We have to hurry!
[Everyone but Junpei runs off.]
JUNPEI: H-Hey! Wait for me!
[The party returns to the lobby. Yukari is on the ground and Mitsuru's bike
has been damaged.]
FUUKA: What in the world...!?
[Two large Shadows are standing across the lobby; one is holding Mitsuru.]
AKIHIKO: There's TWO of em!? Mitsuru!
MITSURU: Ugh... uh...
YUKARI: What's going on!? Nothing's working!
[The Shadows seem to notice the party.]
JUNPEI: Oh shit! They look pissed!
[Natsuki suddenly enters.]
JUNPEI: Hey! Isn't that...!?
AKIHIKO: Why the hell is SHE here!?
NATSUKI: F-Fuuka...
[She falls to her knees.]
FUUKA: ...Moriyama-san?
[Fuuka runs over to Natsuki.]
AKIHIKO: Wait! What are you doing!?
FUUKA: Please, get out of here! It's dangerous!!
NATSUKI: I... I wanted to tell you... I'm sorry...
[One of the Shadows moves towards Fuuka.]
FUUKA: ...!
[Fuuka faces it and pulls out the Evoker.]
AKIHIKO: Wait! That's not a weapon!
FUUKA: I know...!
AKIHIKO: ...!?
[The Shadows reels back to strike Fuuka. Fuuka puts the gun to her head and
shoots it, summoning her Persona, which appears around her and Natsuki. The
Shadow's strike bounces off the Persona's womb-like shield, causing the
Shadow to topple backwards. Mitsuru is dropped to the ground.]
[Akihiko runs over to Mitsuru and Main runs over to Yukari.]
AKIHIKO: Mitsuru!
MITSURU: ...I'm alright. Be careful... Normal attacks won't work on these
Shadows. And all of our instruments have been destroyed...
AKIHIKO: Just stay still! Besides...
FUUKA: ...I can see...
MITSURU: Is that the voice...!?
FUUKA: I... I can sense these monsters' weaknesses, somehow...
JUNPEI: For real!?
AKIHIKO: ...Just as I thought. Mitsuru, let her take your place.
MITSURU: ...I get it now. Yamagishi, can you assist the others?
FUUKA: I'll do my best!
AKIHIKO: Stay back, Mitsuru! We'll take care of this!
[Main, Junpei, and Akihiko begin attacking the Shadows.]
FUUKA: I'll try and find out the enemy's weakness. Just let me
know when.
[After another long battle, the group manages to defeat the Shadows. Fuuka's
Persona disappears.]
FUUKA: Are there more of them...?
AKIHIKO: Don't worry, it's over.
NATSUKI: Fuuka... You...
FUUKA: A-Are you alright...?
NATSUKI: Yeah...
FUUKA: Thank goodness...
[Fuuka collapses.]
NATSUKI: Fuuka!?
MITSURU: It's alright. She's just exhausted.
NATSUKI: Fuuka... Fuuka, I...
AKIHIKO: Where did these two Shadows come from?
MITSURU: From somewhere outside of Tartarus, just like before...
AKIHIKO: I see...
YUKARI: Um, what are we gonna do about Natsuki? She saw the Dark Hour, and the
Shadows...
AKIHIKO: Don't worry, she's not like us, so she won't remember any of it. The
good news is, she didn't fall victim to the Shadows, even though she
obviously heard their call. She should be safe from now on.
YUKARI: But, that means she'll forget Fuuka saved her life, right? That doesn't
seem fair...
MITSURU: Actually, I don't think it'll matter.
NATSUKI: I'm sorry, Fuuka... I'm so sorry...
MITSURU: I think she's learned her lesson.
NATSUKI: I'm sorry...
[The scene fades out.]
dangerous fight. It seems like the trust between you all has grown... You
learned a new tactic! You can now use "Knock Down"! You wonder about the
mysterious boy who appeared again... His warnings seem to be more than just
dreams... ...... You are too exhausted to make any sense of it right now. You
decide to rest as soon as you get back to the dorm...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Yukari there.]
YUKARI: Hey, I was thinking... Do you think Mitsuru-senpai saved Fuuka because
it was the right thing to do? Or was it just because she's a
Persona-user and we need her...?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: I-I guess so.
YUKARI: So, you think so too?
YUKARI: ...Well, whether or not she joins us is up to her... Sorry to bring
this up out of the blue.
[Main and Yukari enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

YUKARI: ...Oh, hey. Mitsuru-senpai and Akihiko-senpai are going to the
hospital to see Fuuka today. I wonder how she's doing...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Mitsuru there.]
MITSURU: Good morning. ...You might like to know that Yamagishi and
Moriyama are healing up well.
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Yes.
MITSURU: We'll need to invite Yamagishi to the dorm and explain what
happened. We could definately use her help.
[Main and Mitsuru enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Ono is teaching Japanese History.]
MR. ONO: Are we talking about the Kamakura era today? I guess not... What,
we haven't covered Heian yet? Well, let's get through it real quick,
then. First, the Taika Reforms. They happened in the year 645. Just
remember that.
MAIN: 
MR. ONO: Huh? What were they about? Oh, nothing important, really.
Argh... I don't care about any of this! I wanna get to the
Sengoku era! It's calling out to me!
increased.
[Main puts his head down.]
eyes... You start to feel better... Your condition is
now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? They're at the hospital again, visiting Fuuka... So, I
guess we're not going anywhere tonight. Man, I wonder when she'll be
ready to come along...
YUKARI: Hey, don't just assume that she'll be joining us... I hope they're not
trying to push her into it...

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Main, Yukari, and Junpei are talking in their homeroom. Main's phone rings.]
TEXT MESSAGE: 
this evening. Come to the command room as soon as you get back."

=== EVENING ===

[Ikutsuki, Fuuka, and everyone else are sitting in the dorm meeting room.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: You're Fuuka Yamagishi, right?
[Fuuka quickly stands up.]
FUUKA: Y-Yes.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Relax, there's no need to be nervous. Why don't you
have a seat?
[She bows and sits back down.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Everyone, you did an excellent job uncovering the truth.
I also wanted to let you know... The three girls have all
regained consciousness.
FUUKA: What a relief...
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: From what I understand, they each came to school around
midnight and waited for the security guard to leave. They were
attacked by Shadows near the gate, as the Dark Hour began...
However, the facts became twisted because of rumors concerning
a ghost story.
YUKARI: I knew right from the beginning that it wasn't a ghost.
FUUKA: It's all my fault.
YUKARI: ...Are you kidding!? You were the victim!
FUUKA: But, I made so many people worry...
YUKARI: Hey, don't think like that...
[Mitsuru gets up and stands next to Fuuka.]
MITSURU: We could have lost that fight if you weren't there. You saved our
lives. You should feel good about yourself. You have a special power
that you can use to help others.
FUUKA: A special power...?
MITSURU: We call it "Persona." You could be a tremendous help to us. Will you
lend us your strength?
FUUKA: Are you asking me to join you...?
[Mitsuru nods.]
FUUKA: Mitsuru-senpai...
[Fuuka looks over at Akihiko and he nods too.]
YUKARI: You know, we're not trying to pressure you, so if you need some time
to think about it...
[Fuuka shakes her head and stands up.]
FUUKA: I'll do it. ...I'll help you!
YUKARI: A-Are you sure!? If you join, you'll have to live here...
FUUKA: That's fine. I'd rather live here than at home anyway...
MITSURU: We really appreciate this. We'll have the school talk to your
parents, to resolve any issues.
FUUKA: Thank you.
YUKARI: ...Wait a minute. Aren't we dragging her into this a bit fast?
FUUKA: Um, it's okay, really...
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Now, then... Those special Shadows showed up again. We still
don't know where they're coming from. But, Akihiko is right
about one thing... Their appearances seem to coincide with the
full moon. We'll take that into consideration from now on.
JUNPEI: So, they're kinda like werewolves then, huh?
AKIHIKO: It's a big advantage for us to know when to expect them. Now, on the
day of the fight, we'll be ready to get in the ring.
YUKARI: ......
[The scene fades out.]
You wonder if this is what the boy was trying to tell you... It seems that
you should start paying attention to the moon's phases...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Yukari there.]
YUKARI: Mornin'. Hey, Main-kun... What do you think about Fuuka?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: That's not what I meant.  Doesn't it seem like... she was
kind of forced into joining us?
YUKARI: You think so? I mean, yeah, her Persona ability is great
n' all, but... Doesn't it kinda seem like she was forced into
joining us?
YUKARI: I hope she'll be okay...
[Main and Yukari enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Some girls in class 2-E are talking.]
NOSY GIRL: Hey, did ya hear? Ekoda's in hot water!
Gossip-Lover: Really? What'd he do?
NOSY GIRL: I don't know, but it must be serious. ...Sexual harrassment, maybe?
Gossip-Lover: Hahaha, I can totally see that!
[Fuuka enters the classroom.]
NOSY GIRL: Hey, look... It's the ghost girl.
Gossip-Lover: Quiet, she can hear you!
FUUKA: Um...
[Natsuki enters the classroom through the same door.]
NATSUKI: Fuuka, you in here?
FUUKA: Moriyama-san...?
NATSUKI: I heard you started living in the dorms.
FUUKA: Y-Yeah...
NATSUKI: You seem so depressed... Let me know if you need someone to talk to.
You could probably use a friend, huh?
FUUKA: Moriyama-san...
NATSUKI: Oh, come on. ...Just call me Natsuki.
FUUKA: ...Thank you...

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? They're getting Fuuka's room ready on the 3rd floor.
But, no guys allowed... It's cool, though. I'm just glad she's coming.
She'll be here tomorrow, you know.

=== DARK HOUR ===

MYSTERIOUS BOY: You've prevailed yet again.
[Main is in his bed; the boy is sitting on the edge.]
MYSTERIOUS BOY: But, it's funny... It doesn't seem so certain, considering the
vast potential within you. As a matter of fact, your power
seems to have changed quite a bit. Hey, if you don't mind, can
I be your friend? I'm very curious about you... Is that okay?
MAIN: 
MYSTERIOUS BOY: Then, from now on, we'll be friends.
MYSTERIOUS BOY: Name...? Oh, I see. I need a name.
MYSTERIOUS BOY: I see your point. You haven't had much say
in the matter.
MYSTERIOUS BOY: My name is... Pharos. You may call me that if you wish.
[Death Social Link is established. The boy disappears and reappears at the
foot of the bed.]
PHAROS: It's getting late, so I'll go now. I'm already looking forward to our
next meeting.
[He vanishes.]

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Mitsuru there.]
MITSURU: Good morning, . Yamagishi will be living in the dorm with
us. And starting tonight, she'll be providing us with support during
battle. So, now I can rejoin the front line.
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Yes, you can depend on me.
MITSURU: ...You'll regret saying that.
MITSURU: Even though I'm a bit out of practice, I will soon return to my prior
form.
[Main and Mitsuru enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

[Main has just arrived at the dorm when his phone rings.]
VOICE ON THE PHONE: Hello? This is Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH: I'm calling to inform you of a change in Tartarus... I believe a
path that was blocked is now open... I thought you might like to
know. ...I wish you a safe journey.
FUUKA: ...Hi, how was your day? Um, since I'll be substituting for Mitsuru-
senpai from now on... just tell me if you want to go to Tartarus. I'll
do my best.

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Yukari there.]
YUKARI: Mornin'. So, I guess it's true that fewer cases of Apathy Syndrome
occur after each of our missions. But then, that changes again as we
get closer to the next full moon. ...By the way, Main-kun, what do you
think about Mitsuru-senpai?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: That's not what I meant.
YUKARI: Don't you think she sort of pushed Fuuka into joining? I know it's nice
to have her around, especially in battle, but... It just feels wrong...
[Main and Yukari enter the school.]

=== AFTERNOON ===

[Ms. Toriumi is teaching Composition.]
MS. TORIUMI: Our language can be very complex... Now then... Junpei's looking
shifty, so how about you, Main?
[Main stands up.]
MS. TORIUMI: Which punctuation goes in the blank? "I like these fruits___
apples, oranges, and grapes."
MAIN: 
MS. TORIUMI: Tsk! If you made a mistake like that on a test, I'd fail
you on the spot. Listen up, all of you. You're giving a
list of the types of fruits you like... So you can't use
anything but a colon! If you do, the sentence will be
wrong.
MS. TORIUMI: That's absolutely correct! You'd make a great composition
teacher someday, Main. Because you're about to give a
list, you'd use a colon there.

=== EVENING ===

AKIHIKO: ...Where have you been? Let's go to Tartarus tonight. I know the next
full moon is still a ways away, but the Shadows are getting stronger.
Besides, I need to train Polydeucues. So, whaddya say?

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Mitsuru there.]
MITSURU: Oh, , I have something to tell you... From now on, you'll
be able to go to Tartarus without me.
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Because Yamagishi can provide support. If she's present, you
can go to Tartarus. But, if neither Akihiko nor myself is
present, I told her not to let you go.
MITSURU: I'm worried something may happen... So, please keep that in mind.
[Main and Mitsuru enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Hey, did you hear there's a few openings in the Culture
Clubs?
LISTENING GIRL: Really? I guess some students transferred out... But it sounds
interesting. I'm tired of going straight home with no
extracurriculars...
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Let's go check out the Art, Music, and Photography Clubs
after school.
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== AFTERNOON. ===

[Mr. Edogawa is teaching Miscellaneous.]
MR. EDOGAWA: All right, let's get started. Pallas aron azinomas... We all need
to start somewhere. Rome wasn't built in a day! The same goes for
magic. It's important to learn the basics. So today, I'll tell
you about the origins of magic. Long, long ago, at the dawn of
civilization, man created primitive religions. Animism, totemism,
and shamanism all fall into this category. You learned them in
world history, right? That last one, shamanism, is important to
the origins of magic. Shamans would fall into a trance state and
act as the intermediary between the worlds, but... It counts as
"magic," where humans can have the power of gods and spirits in
their own hands. This shaman-style magical tradition would later
be embraced by witches. Take the common European witch, as an
example. People today think that witches derived their power from
contracts with the devil... But that's just the image that
Christianity imposed on them. The witches' predecessors were more
like maidens serving the gods. It was through prayer to those gods
that they earned their powers. They learned to control their magic
without losing consciousness during their trance states. That's
how they originally awoke to magic. Originally, Europe was full
of religions that worshipped a slew of various gods. They were
generically called "paganism." And for your information, the
celebrations of Christmas and Halloween have pagan backgrounds.
...Are you all still listening? No trance states, now...
Eeeheehee. I'll give you a little test to see if you're paying
attention. Get it wrong, and your afterlife won't be pleasant.
Pallas aron azinomas... Who should I pick...? All right, Main,
I ask thee.
[Main stands up.]
MR. EDOGAWA: What formed the origins of magic?
MAIN: 
MR. EDOGAWA: Wrong. Enjoy your next life as a chupacabra. Now then,
paganism and Christianity have a tighter connection to one
another than you'd think. As the Roman Empire grew
stronger, so did the population of Christians in the
empire. At first, each religion carried on its own worship
separately, but...
MR. EDOGAWA: Very good... You'll be born into your next life as a
human again. Now then, paganism and Christianity have a
tighter connection to one another than you'd think. As
the Roman Empire grew stronger, so did the population of
Christians in the empire. At first, each religion carried
on its own worship separately, but...

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

If you can find the appropriate room, you might be able to join.

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of boys are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: The Kirijo Company was in the news again yesterday.
LISTENING STUDENT: Kirijo...? The Student Council President? You know, the
Kirijo Company built this whole school.
GOSSIPING STUDENT: I wonder how a company that big was contracted to build a
school...
[Main and the boys enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===


=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? Sorry, bro... I'm on my way to the store.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of boys are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Oh, my teacher told me about Mitsuru Kirijo, the Student
Council President. She's going overseas after she graduates.
Probably so she can run the Kirijo Company later...
LISTENING STUDENT: Wow, that's crazy. She's so different from us...
GOSSIPING STUDENT: The funny thing is, I hear she still lives in the dorms.
I wonder why... Maybe her parents were strict when she was
growing up.
[Main and the boys enter the school.]

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Main, Junpei, and Yukari are in their homeroom. Mitsuru suddenly enters and
walks over to them.]
MITSURU: Mind if I interrupt? I was just told by the Chairman that he'll be
stopping by this evening. When you get back, come to the 4th floor
meeting room.
YUKARI: Oh, um... okay.
MITSURU: I'll see you all later.
[Later, Main arrives at the dorm. Yukari and Fuuka are outside talking to a
dog.]
FUUKA: Koro-chan, give me your paw!
[The dog sticks his paw out.]
YUKARI: Oooh, good dog!
[They notice Main.]
FUUKA: Oh, hi.
YUKARI: Hey, you're back!
MAIN: 
YUKARI: He was just walking down the street.
FUUKA: Sure.
FUUKA: Koro-chan, go say hi!
[The dog walks over to Main.]
FUUKA: His name's Koromaru. I've seen him sitting by the steps of the shrine.
[Another dog suddenly runs over and barks at the girls. A woman follows after
the dog.]
PASSERBY: Oh... This dog still goes on walks all by himself?
YUKARI: ...? Whaddya mean?
PASSERBY: He used to belong to the priest at Naganaki Shrine. Every afternoon,
the two of them went this way for a walk.
FUUKA: That explains it...
PASSERBY: Well, until the priest passed away.
FUUKA: He passed away...?
PASSERBY: Oh, you haven't heard the story? It was about six months ago... The
priest was hit by a car while walking his dog. He didn't survive.
Ever since then, that dog sits patiently by the site of the accident.
And he goes for a walk every day, just like when his owner was still
alive...
PASSERBY: ...Oh shoot, I have to get going! My son will be back soon!
[The woman and the other dog leave in the other direction.]
YUKARI: Aww, you're such a loyal dog! Good boy!
FUUKA: ...Huh?
YUKARI: What's wrong?
[Koromaru wanders off.]
FUUKA: ...Oh, nothing... Sorry. Wait, isn't the Chairman coming today? Then,
we should go get ready.

=== EVENING ===

[The group is in the fourth floor meeting room. Ikutsuki enters.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Hello, everyone. I wanted to let you know how my research has
been going. This concerns those Shadows that have been
appearing during full moons. I want you to listen closely; it
might be hard to follow. Shadows can be divided into 12
categories, according to their characteristics. This, we've
known for a while. It's like their class or order. ...Now, I've
classified the special Shadows we've seen so far, and... It's
simply fascinating!
[Ikutsuki seems to become lost in thought.]
YUKARI: And...?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Oh, sorry. ...Ahem.
[He sits down.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Those four Shadows belong to categories I through IV, in order
of their appearance! They may have looked different than the
more common ones, but the classification scheme still applies.
JUNPEI: Is that something we should be excited about?
FUUKA: Oh, I get it... There's 12 in all... Eight we haven't seen yet.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: That's exactly right, Fuuka! You're quite sharp.
JUNPEI: Oh, uh, okay... But, what are they after?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: ...That's a good question, and that's what we haven't figured
OUT YET: their motive. They don't kill their prey; they feed on
their minds. It can be considered predation, but is it really?
Is there an underlying intent behind their behavior? The
purpose of the Shadows as a whole... That's what we need to
consider.
AKIHIKO: ...This is interesting. But, no matter what, we still have to beat the
rest of 'em.
MITSURU: ...I agree. That's about all we can do at this point.
YUKARI: Eight more, huh? Lucky us.
FUUKA: According to the data, each one has been stronger than the last, so we
better start training harder...
AKIHIKO: We'll manage. We've got plenty of time.
YUKARI: What about Tartarus? Why does it even exist...?
MITSURU: ......
[The scene fades out.]
when the moon is full... You wonder what their purpose is... Eight of them
remain... You still have a long road ahead of you.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Yukari there.]
YUKARI: Hey, Main-kun... I was thinking... The night before last... The 12
Shadows... Tartarus... Isn't there just too much we don't understand?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: It's starting to get to me...
[Main and Yukari enter the school.]

=== AFTERNOON ===

[Ms. Terauchi is teaching English.]
MS. TERAUCHI: Japanese is gaining popularity in other countries, but it doesn't
compare to English. Now, here's a question for... Junpei. Which
language sees the most use worldwide?
JUNPEI: H-How am I supposed to know!? I've never been outside Japan! Hey Main,
what do I say?
MAIN: 
MS. TERAUCHI: Good job, Junpei! It's because of China's sheer
population size. Second is English, which many people
learn as a second language.
JUNPEI: Hahah! Just common sense, Mrs. T! Thanks, Main! I almost looked
like an idiot...
CLASSMATE: Main helped him out. He's really dependable.
MS. TERAUCHI: Come on, Junpei! Just think about it a little, and the
answer should be clear. You know how many people live in
China, don't you?
JUNPEI: Who cares... I'll just stay in Japan for the rest of my life.

=== EVENING ===


=== DARK HOUR ===

[A single teenager is standing in the alley behind Port Island Station.]
TEENAGER: ...Huh...?
[He looks around.]
TEENAGER: How the heck did I--
[He notices the coffins around him.]
TEENAGER: Wh-What the hell is this!?
COLD VOICE: Good evening...
[The teenager looks behind him. Two men and a woman enter the area. One of the
men addresses the teenager.]
PALE YOUNG MAN: Are you surprised? Truth be told, we all visit this world every
night.
TEENAGER: Wh-What are you saying? Who the hell are you?
[The other man steps forward, holding out a paper to the teenager.]
Smart-looking Guy: Didn't Mommy teach you any manners? You haven't introduced
yourself... Take a look. Name, age, address, etc... This
is you, right?
TEENAGER: Wha--!? Where did you get this!?
[The second man puts away the paper.]
Smart-looking Guy: Somebody's got a grudge against you, and they asked us to
get revenge.
TEENAGER: Revenge!? What kinda bullshit is this!? Who put you up to this!?
Smart-looking Guy: Can't tell ya. We're professionals.
TEENAGER: "Professionals"...? Oh shit... You mean, the rumors on the net are
true!?
[The second man steps back; the first man pulls out a revolver and moves
towards the teenager.]
TEENAGER: Hey... W-Wait... I haven't done anything! Why me!? What'd I do!?
PALE YOUNG MAN: That is not our concern. Your notion of right and wrong is
irrelevant. My client's wishes are all that matter. People hear
what they choose to hear, and believe what they want to
believe.
[He raises his gun to shoot.]
TEENAGER: N-No... Stay away... Get away from me!
[The teenager runs off in the other direction.]
PALE YOUNG MAN: You squeal most magnificently! Such raw emotion!
[The man fires and the sound of the body dropping is heard. The woman steps
forward.]
GIRL IN A DRESS: He's not dead...
Smart-looking Guy: Doesn't matter... We've held up our end of the bargain.
Besides, tomorrow this will just seem like some random
crime.
PALE YOUNG MAN: If there's nothing else... I'm feeling rather tired.
[The three of them walk away as the scene fades out.]

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Have you heard of this revenge request website?
LISTENING STUDENT: Revenge request...? What's that?
GOSSIPING STUDENT: You can write the person's name you want to get revenge on,
and bam! Mission accomplished. They say it's guaranteed
successful, and completely anonymous.
LISTENING STUDENT: Seriously!? Give me the URL! Quick!
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Well... It's just a rumor... I mean, I don't know the
details... Why are you so desperate...!?
LISTENING STUDENT: Huh? I'm not... I'm not thinking about revenge at all.
GOSSIPING STUDENT: ......
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

[Shinjiro is eating at the ramen shop.]
SERVER: Hi, how are you today? Just one?
[Akihiko walks in and sits next to Shinjiro.]
AKIHIKO: I'll have what he's having.
SERVER: Coming right up! One house special!
[The server walks off.]
AKIHIKO: ...How can you eat the same thing all the time, without getting sick
of it?
SHINJIRO: Shut up. You always eat that protein shit.
AKIHIKO: Hmph...
[The server comes back with Akihiko's meal.]
SERVER: Here you go, one house special! Be careful, it's hot!
[Akihiko takes his meal.]
AKIHIKO: ...You still haven't made up your mind?
SHINJIRO: ...Is that what this is about?
AKIHIKO: We've got four new members. Things have changed quite a bit since you
left. We're more aggressive now.
SHINJIRO: I'm not interested.
AKIHIKO: Think about it, Shinji. Don't let your power go to waste.
SHINJIRO: My power ain't worth shit.
AKIHIKO: Shinji!
SHINJIRO: I made up my mind a long time ago. I ain't going back.
AKIHIKO: You have to let the past go. What's done is done. It's time you moved
on.
SHINJIRO: Hmph... You should talk.
AKIHIKO: What?
[Shinjiro gets up.]
SHINJIRO: Face it... You're no different than me.
[He walks out. Meanwhile, Main arrives at the dorm.]
MITSURU: Welcome back. We have 2 weeks until the moon is full again. Try to
increase your strength as much as possible before then.
JUNPEI: Two weeks, huh. I wonder what it'll look like this time... I have to
admit, the suspense is killing me...
MITSURU: You're starting to sound like Akihiko. Just remember, this is not a
joke. That reminds me... Why is he not back yet?
JUNPEI: He's prolly eating or somethin'.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Junpei there.]
JUNPEI: Yo! ...Hey, is it just me, or has Yuka-tan been acting weird lately?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Dude, where have you been? We live in the same building!
JUNPEI: Oh, you noticed it too?
JUNPEI: She's been thinking way too hard about Tartarus n' stuff. I mean, who
cares!? Right?
[Main and Junpei enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===


=== EVENING ===


=== EVENING ===

AKIHIKO: ...Where have you been? I'm gonna go out for a bit. See ya later.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Hey, did you hear about all those people who were found
unconscious recently? I guess they were all in pairs.
LISTENING STUDENT: What, like they were attempting a double suicide?
GOSSIPING STUDENT: I don't know. But if I could pass out with someone I liked,
I wouldn't mind being unconscious!
LISTENING STUDENT: I would mind!
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Yukari there.]
YUKARI: Mornin'... Ya know, in about a week, there'll be another mission...
MAIN: 
YUKARI: I wonder what it'll be like this time...
YUKARI: Sheesh! How can you be so calm about it!?
YUKARI: I guess we'll keep fighting until we defeat all 8 that are left. But,
what are we gonna do after that? I've been thinking about this for a
while. I wonder if Mitsuru-senpai is hiding something from us...
[Main and Yukari enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Takenozuka is teaching Physics.]
MR. TAKENOZUKA: Everyone understand the Lorentz force and the left-hand rule?
Then I'm erasing the board! Oh, I've already erased it now, but
it might be on the exam we're having in two weeks. Got it?
Good. Let's move on to free electron density. I was originally
thinking of doing an experiment... but let's go over some
questions instead. Open to page eight. We just covered the
first question, so skip it. Oh, but first... You look sleepy,
Junpei. Let's see if you can answer this. Contact lenses work
according to a certain physical law. Who discovered that
principle?
JUNPEI: W-What? Uhhh... I dunno... I don't wear contact lenses... Hey Main,
do you know?
MAIN: 
MR. TAKENOZUKA: Wrong again. Okay, let's talk about the second
question...
JUNPEI: Wait, what? So what the hell's the right answer, then?
MR. TAKENOZUKA: That's right. Next question...
JUNPEI: Dude... That's it? I got the question right! Don't I deserve
some credit here?
CLASSMATE: Main told Junpei the answer. He's really smart!

=== EVENING ===

[Yukari and Fuuka are in the meeting room.]
YUKARI: Sorry to bother you, Fuuka...
FUUKA: It's okay... What's on your mind?
YUKARI: Well, um... I was hoping you could do me a favor, with your skill...
I was doing some research on our school, and I came across something
strange... Ten years ago, a lot of students missed school for some
reason. They were reported as absent, but I found some records that
suggest it was something serious. Do you know anything about it, Fuuka?
FUUKA: Me? Um, not really...
YUKARI: I know it was a long time ago, but... doesn't it seem suspicious to
you? From what I've heard, this isn't the first time Shadows have
appeared...
FUUKA: Wait, are you saying...?
YUKARI: I don't know. But, I wonder... And I'm not trying to make trouble,
but... Mitsuru-senpai asks kinda weird whenever someone asks questions
about Tartarus.
FUUKA: Does she...?
YUKARI: I just wanna know what happened back then. If it doesn't have anything
to do with the Shadows, then fine.
FUUKA: ...I understand. Okay, I'll see what I can do.

=== EVENING ===


=== DARK HOUR ===

PHAROS: Hi.
[Main is in his bedroom with Pharos again.]
PHAROS: ...Can you guess what I'm going to tell you?
MAIN: 
PHAROS: You're used to it by now, huh?
PHAROS: It's the same thing as always...
PHAROS: ...The next full moon will be in one week. Are you prepared...? Be
careful, okay?
[He disappers and reappears at the foot of the bed.]
PHAROS: I'll come again.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Mitsuru there.]
MITSURU: Good morning. The full moon is almost upon us... Are you prepared?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Good. I'm counting on you.
MITSURU: That is unacceptable... This is not a game. Don't forget what
you're fighting for...
MITSURU: According to the cycle, it should appear on July 7th at midnight, six
days from now. And remember, incidents increase when a full moon is
near, so remain alert at all times.
[Main and Mitsuru enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

AKIHIKO: ...Where have you been? Did you hear? The next operation will be on
July 7th. That means it's going to be a Star Festival special bout.

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Hey, listen to this. Last time I was out with my boyfriend,
he was heading to Shirakawa Boulevard!
LISTENING STUDENT: Whoa, Shirakawa Boulevard? Ewww... I know what was on his
mind!
GOSSPING STUDENT: We've just started dating, but I'm already kind of disgusted.
He's got such a dirty mind... Maybe I should dump him. I
don't want to be the subject of one of those rumors that
goes, "A couple was found unconscious..."
LISTENING STUDENT: Hahah! That'd be great!
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Ekoda is teaching Classic Literature.]
MR. EKODA: As you should all know, there are many theories about the author,
Murasaki Shikibu. That the "Genji Monogatari" had a different
author... That "Murasaki Shikibu" was a shared pen name... Some have
even suggested that Murasaki Shikibu was an alien from outer space.
An intriguing theory... Now, here's a simple question. Which
currency has a picture of Murasaki Shikibu on it? Tell me... Junpei.
JUNPEI: Huh? Me? Wh-What's the answer, Main? I don't carry paper bills with me
much, so I dunno...
MAIN: 
MR. EKODA: That's... not it. Pockets full of small change, eh Junpei?
JUNPEI: Grrr... Stupid Ekoda... This is your fault, Main! Now
everyone's gonna think I'm poor...
MR. EKODA: Correct. Too easy, was it? Next...
JUNPEI: Phew, you saved me... Thanks, Main.
CLASSMATE: Main helped Junpei out! He's a really nice guy.

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Yukari there.]
YUKARI: Mornin'. You know, soon it'll be a full moon. Are you nervous?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: I'm glad I'm not the only one... But still, we have to do this
no matter what...
YUKARI: ...Seriously? How can you be so calm, Main-kun...? I guess we
have to do this no matter what...
[Main and Yukari enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

FUUKA: ...Hi, how was your day? You probably already know this, but the next
full moon will be on Tuesday of next week. I'm sure some kind of Shadow
will show up. Please be ready.

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Junpei there.]
JUNPEI: Yo, what's up? Tomorrow's the big day.
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Dude, I'm totally stoked... like right before a tournament or
somethin', ya know?
JUNPEI: Hellooooooo!? It's a full moon!! And here I am getting all
nervous... Dude, I've got butterflies in my stomach... like
right before a big tournament... Ya know?
JUNPEI: Now, I know how Akihiko-senpai feels before he gets in the ring...
[Main and Junpei enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? Tomorrow's the day, bro. If we lose, then pretty soon
the city will be full of The Lost. ...Just thinking about it gives me
the willies. We better win, man... It's all on our shoulders... Dude,
I don't know if I'll be able to sleep tonight... If you wanna go to
Tartarus, count me in.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Fuuka there.]
FUUKA: Good morning, Main-kun. How are you feeling today?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: Wow, you're amazing! We're going to have a quick meeting tonight
about the operation. So, please return to the dorm immediately
after school.
FUUKA: O-Oh no...! You should rest! By the way, we're going to have a
quick meeting tonight about the operation. Don't forget, now.
We'll meet at the dorm after school.
[Main and Fuuka enter the school.]

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

return to the dorm and prepare yourself.

=== DARK HOUR ===

[Everyone is in the dorm meeting room. Fuuka has summoned Lucia and is using
her to scan for Shadows.]
AKIHIKO: Any luck, Fuuka?
FUUKA: ...Just a moment... I found it! I sense a strong
presence!
JUNPEI: Hey, we were right!
SHUJI IKUSTUKI: Or so it would seem.
FUUKA: It's located in Iwatodai... inside a building on
Shirakawa Boulevard.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Hmm, Shirakawa Boulevard... They've been finding The Lost in
pairs lately... Now I understand why.
MITSURU: In pairs... ...Oh, I get it.
[Lucia disappears.]
FUUKA: Why, what's on Shirakawa Boulevard? I'm not familiar with that area...
YUKARI: I've heard about it, but...
JUNPEI: That's where all THOSE hotels are. That explains a lot! You've heard
about 'em, right Fuuka? Where people go to... you know...
[Fuuka blushes.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Nonsense... They're no different from ordinary hotels. The
rooms are a bit fancier, that's all.
JUNPEI: Aw man, that's it?
YUKARI: I don't know about this... Maybe I shouldn't go...
JUNPEI: You're just like a little kid, Yuka-tan...
YUKARI: Wh-Whatever! Fine. Let's go. But this time, I want a piece of the
action! So, who's gonna take the lead?
MITSURU: I don't see any reason to change leaders now. And Yamagishi, I want
you to handle support during the operation.
FUKA: I'll do my best!
AKIHIKO: Alright, then I'll let you decide on the rest of the team.
Let's do this.
[Main selects the other two members and the group heads over to the love
hotel.]
FUUKA: I sense a powerful Shadow on the 3rd floor! Please head
there immediately!
[The party moves to the 3rd floor and finds the right room. Another large
Shadow is inside.]
YUKARI: Why here, of all places...? Well, let's get this over with!
[The party manages to defeat the Hierophant Shadow.]
FUUKA: Good job. You succeeded once again. I'll be waiting
outside for you.
[Main tries to leave through the door.]
FUUKA: ...! ...Huh!? I still sense a Shadow in that room!
It's not the same one you defeated! But... Where is it hiding?
[Main examines a large mirror on the wall.]
YUKARI: Hm? Is it just me, or is there something strange about this mirror?
[Everything gets bright. Yukari is suddenly shown taking a shower, and only
after a few seconds seems to realize where she is. Meanwhile, Main is
sitting on a bed.]
[Mains looks around.]
are here...
MAIN: 
[There is a flash and Main puts a hand to his head.]
VOICE INSIDE YOUR HEAD: Embrace your desire...
VOICE INSIDE YOUR HEAD: I am the voice of your inner self... Enjoy the
moment... That which cannot be felt is merely a
dream... The present is all we have.
MAIN: 
VOICE INSIDE YOUR HEAD: The future is but a fantasy, memory a fabrication...
Let your desire free you from your shackles... Such is
my wish...
MAIN: 
VOICE INSIDE YOUR HEAD: Pleasure is what you truly want. You stand before the
doorway to bliss. You cannot deny you instincts...
Embrace your desire...
MAIN: 
VOICE INSIDE YOUR HEAD: Why do you resist...? Do not avert your eyes
from the truth...
[Main stands up.]
The shower in the bathroom has been turned off.
[Main walks towards the bathroom door. Yukari emerges from the bathroom in a
towel.]
YUKARI: ...Uh... What was I...?
[She realizes she is wearing next to nothing in front of Main.]
YUKARI: 
[She slaps Main, runs back into the bathroom and closes the door.]
FUUKA: Oh, I can finally reach you! Can you two hear me?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: I'm sorry I couldn't contact you sooner... The Shadow
was interfering with your thoughts... And you all got seperated... The
enemy is still in the same room. Please regroup and hurry there. ...Did
you hear that, Yukari?
YUKARI: ...Uh, sorry... Yeah... I heard you.
FUUKA: Um... Did something happen?
YUKARI: No! Nothing!
[Yukari comes out of the bathroom in her normal clothes.]
YUKARI: Come on! Let's go! If you tell anyone... I won't ever speak to you
again.
[She leaves the room. Main follows her out.]
FUUKA: I'm sorry... I never expected there to be another
Shadow. Its power is blanketing the whole building. I'm pretty sure it's
in that one room you were in before... But, it somehow sealed the door,
so I don't think you'll be able to get in. I'll try to find out if
there's a way to break the seal... Please join the others. They're on
the floor above you.
[Main and Yukari head to the second floor, where they meet the others.]
JUNPEI: There you are! I didn't know there was another Shadow...
Anyway, you okay?
AKIHIKO: So, you guys were on the first floor, huh? I'm surprised there
was another Shadow... Anyway, are you alright?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Yeah, NOTHING weird happened to us or anything...
MITSURU: W-We're fine! Nothing happened!
AKIHIKO: ...Huh? Of course we're okay!
FUUKA: I got it! It's the mirrors! They're giving off the same
energy as the Shadow! Maybe the seal will vanish if you break the
mirrors...
YUKARI: I remember this one mirror we saw on the 3rd floor was different from
the others... When I stood in front of it, I felt kinda strange...
[The party enters a room and breaks one of the mirrors.]
FUUKA: Main-kun! Wake up!
[Main and Yukari are back in the room they were in before.]
FUUKA: Are you okay? I don't think randomly breaking mirrors
is the right approach... But, some of them are definately giving off the
same energy as the Shadow... I'll try to narrow it down, but hopefully,
you'll notice something too. Please be careful if you're going to break
any more mirrors.
[Main and Yukari head back up to the next floor. They enter another room and
break the mirror inside.]
FUUKA: Main-kun! Wake up!
[Main and Yukari are back in the room they were in before.]
FUUKA: Are you okay? Listen carefully... You need to find the
mirrors that show no reflection of you... Break those mirrors!
[The party enters another room and finds a mirror with no reflection of them.
They break it and black energy appears to seep out.]
FUUKA: You weakened the seal! But, there seems to be another
mirror on the floor above you. Please find it...
[The party goes up to the third floor, finds the right room, and breaks the
mirror.]
FUUKA: You've broken the seal on the door! You should be able
to fight the Shadow now.
[The party returns to the large room where the previous Shadow was. A new
large Shadow is inside.]
YUKARI: Because of you... I had to come to this disgusting place! Now, you're
gonna pay!
[The party manages to defeat the Lovers Shadow. They come back to the exit,
where Fuuka is waiting.]
FUUKA: I'm glad you're all safe.
MITSURU: Thanks for your help. The enemy was sly, but you did well.
FUUKA: I did what I could.
MITSURU: And you too, for withstanding the enemy's mental assault.
AKIHIKO: Alright, let's call it a night.
[Mitsuru and Akihiko walk off. Fuuka begins to walk away, but turns back.]
FUUKA: Oh, Yukari. About that thing you mentioned the other day...
YUKARI: You found out something?
[Fuuka nods.]
YUKARI: Cool, tell me later. Alright! We should head back, too.
[Junpei ignores her.]
YUKARI: Come on, Junpei. What are you doing?
JUNPEI: So, you're the hero again, huh?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Yeah, right... You know it's not.
JUNPEI: Yeah, whatever... Who cares, anyway...?
YUKARI: Hey, why do you have to be like that? Don't tell me you're jealous.
JUNPEI: Shut up!
[He walks away.]
YUKARI: What's up HIS butt?
[Yukari and Fuuka leave. Fool Arcana to rank 4.]
you all has grown... You learned a new tactic! You can now use "Full
Assault"!
[Main walks off. The camera pulls back to reveal that the three people from the
scene behind Port Island Station were watching the party from atop a nearby
building. The pale man claps his hands.]
PALE YOUNG MAN: ...Faster than I expected. That was quite a show. They've been
rather busy these last few months, including their frequent
forays into the tower. Their fighting style is positively
fascinating... And it seems they've gained new recruits, too.
[He turns to the other man.]
PALE YOUNG MAN: Well, Jin? Are they our enemy?
Smart-looking Guy: Why don't we ask our "buddy"? We'll be seeing him soon.
PALE YOUNG MAN: Yes... That's an excellent idea. Considering that he shares
our fate, it would be prudent to seek his opinion. We don't
have much time left...
[The scene fades out.]
there will be fewer victims for a while. But, you are too exhausted to think
about it now. You decide to rest as soon as you get back to the dorm...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: It's almost summer break. Let's go somewhere for vacation!
LISTENING STUDENT: Sounds cool to me! I wanna go to the sea, the mountains,
everywhere! But, before that... we've got finals starting
on Tuesday.
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Ugh, I'd forgotten about that. But that means a break is
after the exams! And summer vacation is just around the
corner!
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Ms. Toriumi is teaching Composition.]
MS. TORIUMI: Let's see here... Finals will start next Tuesday. Geez, we just
had an exam. What a pain... Well, maybe "pain" wasn't the word I'm
looking for. English phrases are pretty tricky... Speaking of
English, there are a lot of English terms that are hard to
pronounce. Okay, Main!
MS. TORIUMI: Here's a question for you... Dun dun dunnn! How do you pronounce,
"onomatopoeia"?
MAIN: 
MS. TORIUMI: Bzzzzt! Was that a little too hard? It's
"O-no-ma-to-pee-ah." It's a Greek word, which is why it's
pronounced so strangely. It means "name-making." And
Japanese has some of the most extensive onomatopoeia...
MS. TORIUMI: Whoa! I didn't think you'd get it! Good for you!
Onomatopoeia is a Greek word that means "name-making,"
which is why it's pronounced so strangely. Japanese, you
know, has some of the most extensive onomatopoeia...

=== EVENING ===

YUKARI: ...Oh, hey. Sorry, I need to talk to Fuuka...
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Oh, um, there's something I have to clear up.
YUKARI: Um... I'm feelin' kinda tired today, so I'd rather not.
FUUKA: Everyone must be tired after the mission... Please get a good night's
rest...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A boy and a girl are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: The morning sunrise is so refreshing! The sunlight
reflecting off the windows is beautiful!
LISTENING STUDENT: It's because the building wasn't built that long ago, so
everything is still gleaming. You know, I heard from my
parents there was an explosion here 10 years ago. They
replaced the building after that, but... There's more to
it, too. Around that time, a lot of students stopped coming
to school. Maybe that's why they put up the new building...
To start with a clean slate...
GOSSIPING STUDENT: An explosion!? Did someone screw up in chem lab or
something? That must have been a dangerous lecture...
[Main and the students enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Ono is teaching Japanese History.]
MR. ONO: Umm, today we're scheduled to talk about the Nara era. Let's just
cover the basics, okay? I might put this section on the exam next
week... I'm feeling lazy. Heizei-kyo became the capital in the year
710. Main!
[Main stands up.]
MR. ONO: What happened in 794?
MAIN: 
MR. ONO: You can do better than that! You're descended from the
samurai! The capital was moved from Nagaoka-kyo to Heian-kyo
in 794. And in 894, the Kentoushi--the embassy to China--was
abolished.
MR. ONO: That's right. The capital was moved from Nagaoka-kyo to
Heian-kyo. And in 894, the Kentoushi--the embassy to China--
was abolished.

=== EVENING ===

[Main has just arrived at the dorm when his phone rings.]
VOICE ON THE PHONE: Hello? This is Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH: I'm calling to inform you of a change in Tartarus... I believe a
path that was blocked is now open... I thought you might like to
know. ...I wish you a safe journey.
MITSURU: Welcome back. With each full moon, the Shadows are getting stronger.
They are employing more dangerous attacks, as well... So even though
we have a lot of time until the next full moon, we had best use that
time wisely.

=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Edogawa is teaching Miscellaneous.]
MR. EDOGAWA: Silence! Class is beginning. Sebna uru quah... I plan on using the
word "magic" in a very general sense. But today, we'll talk about
the single most magical place and time. Today's topic is the magic
of medieval Europe. There are a lot of materials pertaining to
western magic, from books to folklore. We'll cover all of it,
including the changes it's gone through. As I mentioned last
time, European magic has its origins in paganism. Starting with
Christianity, though, it's been influenced by the influx of
various cultures. Some well-known examples are... Kabbalah, the
study of the mystical aspects of Jewish texts. Gnosticism, a
Christian sect founded by Simon Magus, the Sorcerer. Greece's
philosophy and natural sciences were the fruits of magical
researchers... The same was true of Islam's scientific advances,
which surpassed Europe's at the time. Now, as for the
circumstances of magic in this age... It was an era where the rule
of Christianity and the insight of the natural sciences collided.
Magicians bravely reached up for a connection with the gods...
Are you all awake? You're not daydreaming, right? Eeeheehee.
A little test, to see if you were listening... Get it wrong, and
you'll get a scary guardian angel. Sebna uru quah... Who should
I choose...? All right, Main, I ask thee.
[Main stands up.]
MR. EDOGAWA: What is the mystical study of Jewish texts?
MAIN: 
MR. EDOGAWA: Wrong! You get a fallen samurai from Okehazama for your
guardian angel. Now then, the magicians of the age
achieved great things... Particularly the famous
"grimoires." Grimoires are collections of a wide range of
magical texts, and...
MR. EDOGAWA: Very good. The magicians of the age achieved great
things... Particularly the famous "grimoires." Grimoires
are collections of a wide range of magical texts, and...

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? Uh... I better go study, since exams are coming up.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Junpei there.]
JUNPEI: Hey, what's up...? ...... Uh, exams are pretty soon... Have you been
studyin'?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: ...Seriously? Like I care...
[Main and Junpei enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Ono is teaching Japanese History.]
MR. ONO: Here we go... The Kamakura era! The samurai finally enter the stage of
history! Main... You don't look anything like a samurai, but let's see
if you know this one.
[Main stands up.]
MR. ONO: This isn't from the Kamakura era, but... The foreigners who came to
Japan were scared of the samurai's appearance. What scared them?
MAIN: 
MR. ONO: Good guess, but the correct answer is their hairdos. This'll
be on the exam next week, so listen well! The foreigners back
then thought the samurai's topknot shot out bullets like a
gun. What a ridiculous thing to think... Samurai are cooler
than that! All right, back to the Kamakura era... The samurai
originated from...
MR. ONO: Correct! This will be on the exam next week, so listen well!
The foreigners back then thought the samurai's topknot shot
out bullets like a gun. What a ridiculous thing to think...
Samurai are cooler than that! All right, back to the Kamakura
era... The samurai originated from...

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Main and Yukari are talking in their homeroom. Main's phone rings.]
TEXT MESSAGE: 
We'll meet on the 4th floor as soon as everyone is back."

=== EVENING ===

[Everyone is sitting in the meeting room.]
MITSURU: ...So, that's what happened on the night of the 7th. It was a
difficult operation.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I see. They're getting tougher... But, it's not all bad news.
I called today's meeting because--
YUKARI: I'm sorry. Before we go on, I'd like to ask Mitsuru-senpai something.
MITSURU: Me...?
YUKARI: Since I joined, so many things have happened... I went along with it,
without really understanding what was going on... But now, I need to
know. I'm gonna ask you straight out... You've been hiding something
from us, haven't you, Senpai? You act like you don't know anything
about the Dark Hour and Tartarus... but they're related to that
accident ten years ago, aren't they?
JUNPEI: What accident...?
YUKARI: There was an explosion near our school, and a lot of people died...
It must've been big news back then. You know about it, don't you?
MITSURU: ...Yes.
YUKARI: Luckily, no students were injured. But... around the same time, a large
number of students were recorded as absent. ...Seems like more than
just a coincidence.
MITSURU: What do you mean?
YUKARI: I dug up some old school records, and found something interesting. The
students who were absent... They all collapsed suddenly, and had to be
hospitalized. Sound familiar? You know, like the girls who bullied
Fuuka...
MITSURU: ......
YUKARI: There has to be an explanation! What really happened on the day of that
accident? The Kirijo Group built our school, so you must know
something! Tell me the truth!
MITSURU: ...I wasn't trying to hide anything to you. It just never seemed
relevant. But...
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: ...It's okay. It's not your fault.
MITSURU: ...Alright. I'll tell you the whole story... The Shadows have many
mysterious abilities. Some research indicates that they can even
affect time and space. We think of them as our enemies, but what if we
could somehow use them to our advantage? They would be a source of
unimaginable power, wouldn't they?
YUKARI: What...?
MITSURU: Fourteen years ago, one man pursued that line of thinking... He was
the former leader of the Kirijo Group, Kouetsu Kirijo... My
grandfather.
[During the dialog, images of Mitsuru's story about her grandfather are shown.]
MITSURU: My grandfather was obsessed with Shadows. He wanted to harness their
power, and create something extraordinary.
FUUKA: Harness their power?
MITSURU: He assembled a team of scientists, and over several years collected a
significant number of Shadows.
JUNPEI: He what!? Damn, that's freaking crazy!
MITSURU: However... Ten years ago, during the final stages of the experiment,
they lost control of the Shadows' power. Consequently, the nature of
the world was altered.
FUUKA: You mean...
MITSURU: Yes... Tartarus and the Dark Hour...
MITSURU: By their account, the mass of Shadows they collected split into
several large ones that then dispersed. These are the Shadows we've
been encountering on nights when the moon is full.
FUUKA: Is that why they've appeared in different places?
YUKARI: Wait a minute... If what you said is true, then why did our school turn
into Tartarus?  ...Don't tell me... That's where they conducted
the experiment!?
MITSURU: ...Yes.
YUKARI: Then... those students who were hospitalized...
MITSURU: I'm afraid it's just as you're thinking. Port Island must have been an
ideal location for them. It was a highly-populated area, and the
Kirijo Group had influence there. They could do as they pleased...
As you guessed, the experiment ten years ago was conducted at
Gekkoukan High School.
YUKARI: ......Does that mean... all we've been doing is cleaning up their
mess!? ...You lied to us?
MITSURU: ......
YUKARI: You knew too, didn't you, Senpai!? They've just been using
us! Or, do you not care as long as you get to fight?
AKIHIKO: That's not true. I have my reasons...
MITSURU: Think what you'd like... It was my decision not to share that
information. ...I'm sorry. I never intended to deceive you. Convincing
you to join SEES was my highest priority. As absurd as it may seem,
only we--with our Personas--can fight the Shadows.
YUKARI: How could you...!?
MITSURU: Besides... some of us were never given a choice. I...
AKIHIKO: Mitsuru... Don't.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Yukari... It's those in the past who are to blame. And they
lost their lives as a result of what they did... We're all in
the same boat, here; none of us deserve the burden that's been
thrust upon us.
YUKARI: But... ......
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: It's been ten years since that incident... No one knows why
those Shadows suddenly returned. But, since they're active,
at least we can find and destroy them... Do you realize what
this means?
[Everyone looks at him.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: What if I told you that those twelve Shadows are the cause of
everything?
AKIHIKO: Then, if we defeat them all, Tartarus and the Dark Hour will
disappear...?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Exactly! That's what I was going to tell you earlier. See, it's
good news, isn't it?
FUUKA: Is that true!?
[He nods.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: There's evidence to support it. Now, our true battle begins.
YUKARI: ......
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Regardless of what's happened in the past, we must fight to
protect the people. The Shadows are gaining strength. We can't
afford to just wait for them. And there are many mysteries
still surrounding Tartarus. Why did such a gigantic structure
appear in the first place? The answer must lie within it.

=== DAYTIME ===

[Shinjiro is at the area behind Port Island Station. Akihiko approaches him.]
AKIHIKO: Nothing to do as usual, huh?
SHINJIRO: Hm...? Hmph... Why're you here? If you came here to try and convince
me, then forget it.
AKIHIKO: ...It's nothing like that. I just wanted to see how you were doing.
SHINJIRO: Huh?
[Akihiko sits down.]
AKIHIKO: We've known each other for a long time... It's been almost 14 years
since we met at the orphanage... You, me, and Miki... We used to run
around here until the sun went down. Back then, it seemed like we had
all the time in the world.
SHINJIRO: Heh... You haven't changed one bit. If you wanna get all sappy, go do
it with your other friends.
[Akihiko stands back up.]
AKIHIKO: ...What was that!?
SHINJIRO: It's rare for you to think about the past. Usually, you just charge
ahead like a damn fool. So obviously, there's something on your mind.
AKIHIKO: ......I do reminisce sometimes... But, what's the point? ...Anyway, we
finally know how to get rid of Tartarus and the Dark Hour.
SHINJIRO: No shit?
[Akihiko nods.]
AKIHIKO: To be honest, all I've been thinking about lately is getting stronger.
But yesterday, someone made me question my reason for fighting...
SHINJIRO: Your reason for fighting, huh... That's different for every person.
But, if you don't have a good one, you can always quit... like I did.
AKIHIKO: ...I'm not like you. ...Man, I can't believe I'm the one getting
lectured here.
SHINJIRO: ......
AKIHIKO: Well, see ya around.
[He walks away.]
SHINJIRO: Tch... You haven't changed at all...
[Meanwhile, Fuuka is in her room at the dorm. Someone knocks on the door.]
FUUKA: Yes?
MITSURU: ...Can I talk to you for a moment?
FUUKA: Senpai... Oh, please come in.
[Mitsuru enters and they both sit down.]
MITSURU: Not only do you excel at providing support during battle, but also at
obtaining information.
FUUKA: Oh, I-I'm sorry for doing that without permission...
MITSURU: Don't worry, you're not in trouble. But, I do have a special favor to
ask of you. I want you to find out as much as you can about that
incident ten years ago.
FUUKA: But, very little was made public...
MITSURU: That's why I want you to access the Kirijo Group's database.
FUUKA: You mean, hack into their system? That's illegal.
MITSURU: I'll give you my ID and password. You'll be free from accountability.
I want to know the truth, in detail.
FUUKA: Senpai...
MITSURU: Of course, I'll understand if you refuse.
FUUKA: Okay. I'll see what I can do.
MITSURU: Are you sure? ...I appreciate it.
[She gets up and walks towards the door, then stops.]
MITSURU: Yamagishi... Aren't you resentful? After all, despite my good
intentions, I did drag you into this without fully explaining.
Certainly, you must be a little angry with me...
FUUKA: Not really. You see, my parents have an inferiority complex because all
my relatives are doctors... That's why they're so tough on me... It's
really hard for me to be at home... But here, I feel important, and I
can help you and the others... So, why should I be angry?
MITSURU: You're right, Yamagishi. We do need you. No one can take your place.
FUUKA: U-Um...
MITSURU: Thank you... I'll see you later.
[Mitsuru leaves. Meanwhile, Junpei is sitting outside the theater at Port
Island Station.]
JUNPEI: So, Tartarus and the Dark Hour will be gone, huh... Tch!
[He stands up.]
JUNPEI: That's good... That's what we've been fighting for... So, why am I so
pissed!?
[A couple of students exit the theater.]
STUDENT: Gosh, it's hot... Even for July.
Student's Friend: Seriously. But, at least we're seniors now... We won't be
wearing these stupid uniforms much longer.
STUDENT: Yeah, I've had enough of this. I just wanna get accepted to college
and start having some fun.
Student's Friend: That's IF you get accepted, don't forget.
[They walk away.]
JUNPEI: Haha, I know why... I'M the reason... I was like, "Fighting is my
duty." But hell, it's all I'm good for. If it weren't for that...
I'd be worthless. Haha, my duty...? What a buncha bullshit. I can't
fight worth shit, anyway... Not compared to HIM, at least. Dammit!
Nothing I do is good enough!
[Meanwhile, Yukari is in her room looking at some papers.]
YUKARI: ...... Seems like my worst fears keep coming true... Am I stupid to
believe in things like trust and friendship...? Dad... This old letter
of yours... I must've read it a thousand times since it came last
spring...
LETTER: "March 6th, 2000. To my family,
Tomorrow, I'll bring this letter to the opening ceremony for the
Moonlight Bridge. It'll be stored in a time capsule, and sent to you
ten years from now. Yukari... You're so small right now, but in ten
years, you'll be sixteen. You'll be in high school."
YUKARI: ......
[She flips to the next page.]
LETTER: "I know you've been sad because I have to work so late, but you still
always greet me with a smile. I'm really proud of myself. Kirijo-san
appointed me Head Researcher. I'll be starting on a big project soon,
and I'm happy to be receiving so much recognition for my work... But,
I swear to you that nothing is more important to me than you and your
mother."
[She flips to the third page.]
LETTER: "Yukari... Are you remembering to enjoy life? Are you still bright-eyed
and hopeful, like you are now? No matter what happens in the next ten
years, I hope you are happy. ...Well, I hope this letter brings a
smile to your face.
Love, Dad"
YUKARI: ......
[She folds the letter and stands up.]
YUKARI: I can't lose hope... for his sake. I won't turn my back. I won't be
like Mom. Not ever...

=== DARK HOUR ===

PHAROS: It's good to see you again.
[Main and Pharos are in Main's room again.]
PHAROS: How long has it been since we first met? Time passes so quickly. So,
how's life as a Persona-user?
MAIN: 
PHAROS: Oh, that's good to hear.
PHAROS: I wonder what... I hope you find it soon.
PHAROS: Well, the choice is yours.
PHAROS: I remembered something else about the coming of the end... It all goes
back to an occurance that took place many years ago... Ten years ago,
if I remember correctly. Hey... Didn't your parents pass away about ten
years ago?
[He disappears and reappears at the foot of the bed.]
PHAROS: A Persona is like a mirror. Which means, a Persona-user can never
escape from his true self. Regardless, I will stay with you... because
we're friends.
[He vanishes. Death Arcana to rank 3.]

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Finals start tomorrow... I feel like we just finished
exams a little while ago.
LISTENING STUDENT: What am I going to do if I fail again? I wish the school
wouldn't post our names...
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Yeah, that's the worst part. You get a bad grade, and
everyone looks at you like your dog just died...
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Ms. Terauchi is teaching English.]
MS. TERAUCHI: Exams will start tomorrow...Are you all ready? Summer vacation
is just ahead, so study hard! Speaking of summer vacation...
Did you know the school year is different in America? There, the
school year ends in June, while the Japanese school year ends in
March.
MAIN: 
MS. TERAUCHI: ...So, those are the main differences between the
Japanese and American school systems. If you ever get a
chance to study abroad, I think you'd get a lot out of
it. The difference between learning about a foreign
culture and living in one is night and day!
increased.
[Main puts his head down.]
eyes... You start to feel better... Your condition is
now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===

[The party is gathered around the table in the lounge.]
YUKARI: ......
MITSURU: ......
FUUKA: Um... Y-You know, it's almost summer break. Do you have any plans?
JUNPEI: I wish I could go to the beach. Hot sand, cool breeze... Babes in
bikinis... Man, it sure would be nice! Somewhere in the south, where
the water is crystal clear! But first, we have exams to worry about...
Ugh, what a drag...
FUUKA: Now, now. You'll be fine. But yeah, I'd love to go somewhere famous for
its beautiful beaches, like Okinawa.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Well, it's not Okinawa, but how about Yakushima?
[Ikutsuki enters.]
MITSURU: Mr. Chairman... I didn't realize you were here.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I happened to be in the area, so I thought I'd drop by and tell
you my schedule for next week. Mitsuru, your father will be
vacationing in Yakushima during the break.
MITSURU: He will...?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: You'll all have some time off after exams, right? Why don't you
go and pay him a suprise visit?
JUNPEI: Seriously!? We're gonna go on a trip!? YES! Beach babes, here I come!
YUKARI: Men.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: How about it, Mitsuru?
MITSURU: But... my father is a busy man; I don't want to ruin his vacation.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Haha, don't worry... No father would be upset with a daughter
who came all that way to see him. You've all done a great job.
You deserve to relax for a while. We already know when the next
operation will be, so it should be fine.
MITSURU: ...... Alright. I guess everyone needs a break now and then. Let's do
it.
JUNPEI: Woohoo!
AKIHIKO: Hmm, the beach... I should design a special training regimen.
JUNPEI: Dude, I'm stoked!
FUUKA: I have to go buy a swim suit.
JUNPEI: Hey, don't worry, I've got an extra pair you can borrow.
AKIHIKO: Nice try, man.
FUUKA: Are you going to swim too, Ikutsuki-san?
IKUTSUKI: I'm afraid I--
[Mitsuru walks off; Yukari follows her to the base of the stairs.]
YUKARI: Um, Senpai! Uh... Sorry about the other day... I got a little carried
away...
MITSURU: ...Don't worry about it. In a way, it's only logical that we go to
Yakushima. The Chairman said that no one who was responsible for the
accident is still alive, but... in reality, there is one witness who
survived.
YUKARI: There is?
MITSURU: My father.
[She walks away up the stairs.]
YUKARI: Senpai...

JUNPEI: Yo, what's up? ...... Thank god today's the last day of exams...
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Dude, I can't wait to let off some steam... Don't you just love
summer...?
JUNPEI: Don't ask. I can't wait to let off some steam... Dude, don't
you just love summer?
[Main and Junpei enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===


=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Main, Yukari, and Junpei are sitting at their desks. Junpei stands up.]
JUNPEI: I'm done, baaaby!! The dark days of testing are finally over! The sun
is shinin' bright!
[Yukari gets up.]
YUKARI: So, how'd you do?
JUNPEI: Hey, check it out! I aced P.E.!
YUKARI: Well, that pretty much answers the question.
JUNPEI: Psh, a real man doesn't dwell on the past... I'm thinking ahead to
Yakushima!
YUKARI: Oh yeah, that's coming up soon, isn't it...?  Are ya ready?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: ...I guess I should start getting ready, too.
YUKARI: Why am I not surprised? If it makes you feel any
better, I'm not ready either.
YUKARI: Me? Um, not really...
YUKARI: I guess I should be more enthusiastic, huh? Hey, I don't have practice
today, so do you wanna do something?
JUNPEI: Sounds good! Where we goin'? If you need to buy a swimsuit, I'd be
happy to help!
YUKARI: As if. Alright, gimme a sec. I'm gonna go grab my stuff from the locker
room. ...Oh, I'll invite Fuuka too.
[She leaves.]
JUNPEI: Hey... I know I've been kind of a dick lately... but we're still cool,
right?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Thanks, dude.
JUNPEI: Dude! I'm tryin' to be serious, here.
JUNPEI: ...Dude, nothin' seems to faze you. You're definately one-of-
a-kind.
JUNPEI: Anyway, that's all history... It's you and me now, bro. Alright, let's
get going.
[The scene changes to in front of the school. Main, Yukari, Junpei, Fuuka, and
Akihiko walk outside.]
JUNPEI: Woohoooooo! Freedom at last! What should I do now!?
FUUKA: Don't worry, I'm sure you'll think of something.
JUNPEI: Hell yeah, I will! ...Hey, what're you doing here, Akihiko-san?
AKIHIKO: Ikutsuki-san called me. I think he wants to talk about a new
candidate.
YUKARI: Does that mean another person is going to join?
AKIHIKO: Maybe...
NATSUKI: Fuuka!
[Natsuki enters from the school building.]
FUUKA: What's wrong, Natsuki-chan?
NATSUKI: Do you think you can stay after school with me for a mandatory study
session? There's, like, no one-- Oh, you're going back to your "home"
home today, huh? Okay, then never mind.
[She starts back towards the school.]
FUUKA: Hey, wait. It's alright. Let's go.  Sorry, I'll see you
all later back at the dorm.
[Fuuka and Natsuki go back inside the school.]
JUNPEI: I'm really surprised at how much she's changed.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Ah, friendship... How beautiful! Adolescence is such a
wonderful thing! So full of vibrancy!
[Ikutsuki walks in from the other direction.]
YUKARI: Mr. Chairman...!
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Oh, hello. I just stopped by to pick someone up. I might as
well introduce you to him now.
[Ikutsuki calls to someone offscreen; Ken enters and stands next to him.]
KEN: Hello.
YUKARI: Oh, hi, Ken-kun. What's up?
AKIHIKO: You know him...?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: He doesn't leave during the break because of his...
circumstances.
YUKARI: Oh, I heard about that... Something about his parents...
KEN: It was only me and my mom, but she got in an accident, and she... she
died. It happened two years ago.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: ...Right now, one of his distant relatives is paying for his
school expenses. But, staying at the elementary school dorm all
by himself isn't proper for a child his age. So, I decided to
move him to your dorm for the summer.
YUKARI: To OUR dorm!? Do you really think that's a good idea!?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Why, of course. He has the potential.
AKIHIKO: Then, he's the new candidate...?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Yes... But, as you can see, he's still just an elementary
school student. So, it is merely a possibility for now.
AKIHIKO: ......
KEN: Are you... Sanada-senpai?
AKIHIKO: Um... yeah.
KEN: I've heard a lot about you... You haven't lost a boxing match yet.
AKIHIKO: Yeah, well... It's nice to meet you. ......

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: Finally, some time off. Yakushima, here we come! I can't wait for
Monday! And then, one week of school 'til summer break! Frickin'
awesome, dude!
YUKARI: Aren't you getting a little carried away? I mean, the trip is only for
a few days, and we'll still have to fight Shadows over summer break.
In other words, we can't afford to stop training in Tartarus...
JUNPEI: I know, I know! But, my energy level is so high during summer, no one
can stop me! Anyway, tomorrow I'm gonna start packing, so if we're
going to Tartarus, then let's do it today.

=== EARLY MORNING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

for you to get ready...
[Everyone is on the ferry to Yakushima. Junpei leans against the railing.]
JUNPEI: Hahaaaa! Awesome! There it is... Yakushima!
[He looks back at the others.]

=== DAYTIME ===

[The party enters a mansion of some sort.]
FUUKA: Wow...
JUNPEI: It's like we're in an episode of Lifestyles of the Rich and Fabulous...
[A couple of maids approach.]
MAIDS: Welcome back, Milady.
MAID: And you must be her schoolmates, correct? Welcome to the Kirijo vacation
home. Please follow me.
YUKARI: Um, is this the right place?
JUNPEI: Dude, real-life maids...
FUUKA: I knew she was from an important family, but this definitely confirms
it...
[The party begins following the maids. An older man walks in from the other
direction.]
Impressive-looking Gentleman: ......
[He begins to walk by the party; he stops next to Mitsuru.]
MITSURU: It's good to see you.
[He takes a brief glance at her before leaving.]
FUUKA: Was that...?
YUKARI: ...her father?
JUNPEI: Dude, talk about scary! He's not gonna make us walk the plank, is he?
AKIHIKO: Don't be stupid...
MITSURU: We won't be here long, but make yourself at home.
JUNPEI: Sweet! This is gonna rock! Hey, wanna go to the beach? It's right
there. Dude, this place rules! Come on, let's go!
YUKARI: What, already? I mean, sure, but let me get changed first!
JUNPEI: Then, I'll see ya there. I'm not gonna waste a single minute!
[Later, Main, Junpei, and Akihiko arrive at the beach.]
JUNPEI: Ahh... Got my sandals on... Givin' my feet a chance to breathe... Yup!
Summer's here!
AKIHIKO: Darn... There's nothing out there I can use as a marker... Too bad.
I was hoping for a good swim.
JUNPEI: You must be joking... We come all the way to the beach and you're gonna
train?
AKIHIKO: What's wrong with that? You got a better idea?
JUNPEI: Damn right, I do! It's summertime at the beach! I've got the perfect
activity!
[He moves over to where Yukari is entering from.]
YUKARI: ...What?
[Junpei begins talking as she walks over.]
JUNPEI: Say hello to contestant No. 1, Yukari Takeba! As you can see, she's
chosen a bold design--quite unexpected! It takes a lot of confidence
to pull off a swimsuit like that!
[Yukari looks at him and he plays innocent. Fuuka enters.]
FUUKA: Is that umbrella taken?
JUNPEI: Next up is Contestant No. 2, Fuuka Yamagishi! ...Wow, Fuuka, I had no
idea you were so... I mean, you should wear a swimsuit more often!
FUUKA: Huh...?
[She hides behind Yukari.]
JUNPEI: Oh come on, there's nothing to be embarrassed about! Heheh.
YUKARI: Stop that creepy laugh, you perv!
JUNPEI: And here's our final contestant...
[Mitsuru enters and looks around.]
MITSURU: ...Hm? Is something wrong?
FUUKA: Wow... Mitsuru-senpai, you're beautiful...
YUKARI: Yeah, your skin is flawless! Did you already put on sunscreen?
MITSURU: N-No, not yet...
[Yukari and Fuuka crowd around Mitsuru; Junpei walks back over to Main.]
JUNPEI: So... Which one's your type?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Aha! Just as I thought.
JUNPEI: Oh, reeeally? Very interesting.
JUNPEI: Whoa, seriously!? You got balls, man!
JUNPEI: Yeah, like I believe that.
JUNPEI: Man, this is great! I'm in heaven! How 'bout a swim!? Buh buh buh bump
ba baaa! Charge!
[Junpei and Akihiko walk out into the water. Main begins to follow them, but
stops and looks around.]
JUNPEI: Whoa, it's cold!! Hahahahaha!!
[Main runs into the water.]

=== EVENING ===

[Mitsuru is waiting in the hallway. Her father walks in.]
MITSURU: It's been a while. I'm glad that you're in good health...
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: Our guests are residents of the dorm, I presume.
MITSURU: I'm sorry for bringing such a crowd...
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: ...I heard you told them about the incident. Why did you hide
it so long?
MITSURU: ...I wasn't hiding it...
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: I've told you time and again; none of the blame is yours.
MITSURU: But...
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: "Two in harmony surpasses one in perfection." That has been
our guiding principle since the Kirijo Family seperated from
the Nanjo Group. You must learn to trust in others, Mitsuru.
There are things in this world that cannot be accomplished
alone, no matter how many sacrifices you make.
MITSURU: ...Yes, Father.
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: You accessed our database, didn't you? That's another thing...
Why didn't you ask me directly, instead of using this trip as
an excuse?
MITSURU: I'm... I'm sorry.
[Takeharu takes a few steps towards his office.]
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: Bring them here. All of them. I had no intention of concealing
the truth from them. I've made prepartions to disclose
everything. There's a girl named Takeba in your group,
correct? For her to awaken to her power... It must be fate...
MITSURU: Father...?
[He walks into his office. Later, everyone is sitting inside the office.]
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: From what I understand, Mitsuru has already given you the
short version.
[Yukari nods.]
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: Well, it's true... We adults are to blame. If I could've
atoned for it with my life, I would have done so... Now, I
have no choice but to rely on you. What my father wanted to
create with those monsters' power... was a time manipulation
device.
MITSURU: That's what he was trying to do?
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: Imagine if you could control the flow of time... eliminate
unwanted events before they occur. With such a device, you
could shape the future to your liking.
JUNPEI: Damn, that's insane...
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: However, under my father's direction, the research began to
stray from its original goal. ...In his later years, my father
seemed to have only nihilism in his heart. Now that I think
about it, his madness may have resulted from his struggle to
break free from that... It's only natural that you want to
know the truth... and it's my duty to tell you.
[A video recording suddenly turns on.]
AKIHIKO: What's this...?
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: This is the only exisiting footage of the accident, recorded
by a scientist who was at the scene.
SCIENTIST: I pray that this recording reaches safe hands...
YUKARI: That voice...!?
SCIENTIST: My employer has become obsessed with a loathsome idea. This
experiment should have never even been conceived... I'm afraid what
I've done will result in an unprecedented disaster... But if I
hadn't, the entire world may have paid the price...
FUUKA: The entire world?
SCIENTIST: Please, listen carefully... The Shadows that were amassed here have
been dispersed as a result of the explosion. To end this nightmare,
you must eliminate all of them! I am to blame for this. I knew the
risks, but I was blinded by the promise of success... And so, I
didn't raise any objections... It is all my fault...
YUKARI: ...!?
[She stands up.]
YUKARI: ...Dad...
FUUKA: You mean... that was...?
YUKARI: ......
[The video recording ends.]
MITSURU: Father...
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: His name was Eiichiro Takeba... He was the head researcher at
the time, and a very talented man. But, we are the ones who
are responsible. We pushed him to continue the research. The
Kirijo Group is to blame for his death.
MITSURU: I... I can't believe it...
YUKARI: So, that means... my dad caused it all...? The Dark Hour, Tartarus...
The people who died in that incident... It was all his fault...?
AKIHIKO: Y-You okay?
YUKARI: So, that's why you were hiding this...? Because you felt sorry for me?
Is that it!?
MITSURU: No, Takeba, I...
YUKARI: I don't want your pity!!
[She runs out.]
FUUKA: Um... Shouldn't someone go after her?
MITSURU: ......  Will you go...?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: ...Thank you.
MITSURU: I doubt she'll listen to me...
MITSURU: Please...
[Main follows after Yukari.]

=== LATE NIGHT ===

[Yukari is standing on the beach; Main walks over to her.]
YUKARI: I believed in him for so long... This is too much... Remember what I
told you at the hospital...? How my dad died when I was little...? You
understand now, right...? He died in that incident. Nobody knew the
truth, so there were all sorts of rumors... Because he was in charge of
the research team, people were really mean to me and my mom... We even
had to move a few times.
MAIN: 
YUKARI: ...Yeah.
YUKARI: Sorry, I'd rather not talk about it...
YUKARI: But all this time, I kept telling myself it wasn't his fault. I loved
him a lot, and I believed he'd never do anything wrong. I received a
letter back in the spring. It was from him, written ten years ago...
It cracked me up cuz, even though it said "To my family," it was pretty
much all about me. That only made me believe in him more... When I
found out I had a special power, I thought it was fate. I was scared,
but I thought if I cooperated with the Kirijo Group, I might find out
what really happened. That's why I agreed to fight using my Persona.
But, it turns out... all of that was for nothing...
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Haha, you're just trying to make me feel better.
YUKARI: ...Sorry, ain't gonna happen.
YUKARI: Why does reality have to be so harsh...? I tried so hard to fight my
fear, and this is what I get... Maybe I'm just jealous of Mitsuru-
senpai. I mean, why my father and not hers...? Haha... I'm a horrible
person, aren't I?
MAIN: [No, you're not...}
YUKARI: Hmph. Well, you're just Mr. Perfect. Nothing ever fazes you. And now,
you've got the nerve to try and tell me how to feel!? You think you
know me!? You don't know anything!
[She pauses for a while.]
YUKARI: I'm sorry... My head's a mess... I'm so afraid... I don't know what to
do anymore... I'm totally lost... Tell me... What should I do...?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: You mean, keep believing...?
YUKARI: Huh...?
YUKARI: Huh...?
YUKARI: Ya know, you really are one-of-a-kind. ...I'm sorry for acting like
this. You've lost your parents, too. But, I'm alright now... I'm
used to dealing with stressful situations. Anyway, thanks for
listening. Lemme guess... Senpai asked you to bring me back, right?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: I knew it. But, still... Thanks.
YUKARI: Oooh, you're such a gentleman...  ...Thanks.
MAIN: 
[Main hugs her.]
YUKARI: ......
YUKARI: Ha...haha... This is kinda awkward, isn't it?
JUNPEI: Hey!!
[Junpei runs in. If Main and Yukari were hugging, they quickly pull apart.]
JUNPEI: Sheesh... What's taking you so long...? Everybody's...
waiting... It's almost...  the Dark Hour, so you should get back.
YUKARI: Huh? Oh, yeah, that's right...
JUNPEI: ...Hm? Um... Did I miss something...?
YUKARI: I-I almost forgot... It doesn't matter where you are when the Dark Hour
comes...
JUNPEI: Well, duh.
YUKARI: You know, I've been thinking lately... Once you awaken to the power of
Persona, you remember everything that happens during the Dark Hour...
It's like trading away your innocence... In exchange for power, you can
no longer look away from the things you don't want to see. So, I guess
I'm stuck with you guys, huh?
JUNPEI: Yup. Now that that's settled, let's get back!
[Junpei and Yukari walk off. Main starts to follow them, but stops and looks
around.]

=== DAYTIME ===

[Yukari, Mitsuru, and Fuuka are walking along a forest trail.]
FUUKA: Ah, the air is so fresh... I never thought a walk in the woods could be
so enjoyable. You can't do this in Iwatodai.
[The other girls don't respond, so they continue walking. Fuuka stops again a
little further on.]
FUUKA: Oh, so listen to this... Junpei was acting like such a pervert
yesterday, and I didn't know how to react... It's probably a good thing
we came out here by ourselves...
YUKARI: Huh? ...Oh, yeah.
[Mitsuru's transceiver rings, so she answers it.]
MITSURU: Mitsuru speaking...
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Uh, Mitsuru... We have a slight problem.
MITSURU: Please continue.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Well, I'm at the lab here on the island... And
a machine that was considered inoperable suddenly left the
facility on its own...
YUKARI: A machine...?
FUUKA: What kind of machine is it? I need detailed information to locate
anything other than Shadows...
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: It's a combat vehicle--an anti-Shadow weapon,
to be precise.
YUKARI: A combat vehicle...? You mean like a tank!?
MITSURU: We're not currently with the others, so it might take some time for us
all to assemble.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I see... Well, regardless, I want you to
handle this as soon as possible. I'm on my way there now.
MITSURU: If the target cannot be captured, do we have permission to destroy it?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I highly doubt you'll be able to
destroy it.
FUUKA: What...? Then how are we supposed to stop it...?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Just do your best. I'll call you again later.
[Yukari tries to use her cell phone.]
YUKARI: ...Great, no one's answering.
MITSURU: Don't worry about it. Let's go back and get our equipment. Then we can
have Yamagishi's Persona scan the area. Although, this island is quite
large...
YUKARI: Geez! Where could they be!?
[Meanwhile, the boys are on the beach. Junpei is looking at a note.]
JUNPEI: This says, "We've gone to see the Jyomon-Ceder Tree."
AKIHIKO: It looks like Fuuka's handwriting...
JUNPEI: Aw man! We're at an island resort in the middle of summer! Why don't
they go to the beach!? That's just not right!!
AKIHIKO: Well, it is your fault.
JUNPEI: Whaddya mean? I-I just wanted to lighten up the mood...
AKIHIKO: I don't want to hear it.
JUNPEI: Well, it doesn't matter, anyway... We're on our own now, just the guys!
If you're outta ammo, you pick it up on the battlefield! That's one of
the most basic military tactics! We'll call this Operation Babe Hunt!
AKIHIKO: "Babe Hunt"? You mean, like, pick up girls...?
JUNPEI: Whaddya think, Akihiko-san? With you on the squad, we're guaranteed to
succeed!
AKIHIKO: What do you think about this?
MAIN: 
AKIHIKO: You're right, it does sound like a hassle...
JUNPEI: Then, what're we gonna do the rest of the day? Come on, guys!
It'll be fun!
JUNPEI: You two want to let this opportunity to enjoy our summer
vacation go to waste? Come on, guys! It'll be fun!
AKIHIKO: Then I'm appointing him our leader, as usual.
JUNPEI: What!? WHY!?
AKIHIKO: You said yourself this is an operation.
JUNPEI: Aw, man, that's bullshit!
[Akihiko walks away.]
JUNPEI: You better take this seriously... It's an important operation.
[Main and Junpei follow Akihiko. They move along the beach and spot a couple of
girls under an umbrella.]
JUNPEI: Oooh! We found some senoritas! Let's go hit on 'em!
[They move closer.]
JUNPEI: Beep... Beep... BEEP! Target confirmed! Let's move in for the kill!
This is my area of expertise, so listen up... First off, think of
something to talk about--something they might be interested in. Give
them an easy question to get the ball rollin'. That's the golden rule.
Somethin' like, "Where're you from?" or "Havin' fun?" Pretty soon,
you'll be tossin' questions and answers back and forth like you're
playin' catch. I'll start things off, and you can ask the questions,
alright? ...Here we go.
[They walk over to the girls.]
JUNPEI: Hey, ladies!
MAIN: 
GIRL IN GREEN: ...None of your business.
JUNPEI: Hey, no need to be shy... We don't bite.
GIRL IN YELLOW: Why should we tell you?
JUNPEI: Come on, cut us some slack... We just wanna talk.
AKIHIKO: I thought you said you were an expert...
JUNPEI: Hold your horses... I'm just getting warmed up. Watch and learn...
So, ladies, are you in college?
GIRL IN ORANGE: Umm... Don't tell me you guys are still in high school...
MAIN: 
[Nope. Not us.]
GIRL IN GREEN: ...Seriously? You sure look like high schoolers from
here.
JUNPEI: S-Sorry, that's a lie.
GIRL IN GREEN: Oh, really?
GIRL IN GREEN: High school kids vacationing in Yakushima? That kind of pisses
me off.
AKIHIKO: Well, we were invited to our friend's vacation home... Pretty cool,
huh?
GIRL IN ORANGE: Good for your friend. We, on the other hand, have to pay for
our vacation with our hard-earned money.
JUNPEI: I guess we're just lucky...
GIRL IN YELLOW: Yeah, lucky you. ...Whaddya want, anyway?
MAIN: 
GIRL IN GREEN: Then, take a hike.
GIRL IN GREEN: Huh? Hahaha, you're pretty bold...
GIRL IN ORANGE: Hey, stop giving them compliments and just ignore
'em...
JUNPEI: W-Wait, don't do that! How can you blame us for wanting to talk
to such beautiful women?
GIRL IN YELLOW: These guys are full of shit.
GIRL IN GREEN: Yeah, let's get outta here.
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Come on, give us a chance... How 'bout a walk on the
beach?
GIRL IN ORANGE: You're annoying.
GIRL IN YELLOW: See ya, boys.
[They leave.]
AKIHIKO: ...So much for your "expertise."
JUNPEI: Hey, I did my best! What about you, Senpai!? You think you can do any
better? Come on, show us what you got.
AKIHIKO: Wh-Why should I?
JUNPEI: Well, you're supposed to be a tactical master, right? And, isn't it our
duty to help each other succeed?
AKIHIKO: ...... I guess you have a point there. Fine. I'll give it a shot. I'm
sure I'll do better than you. Can you give me a hand, Main? I'll set
the pace, of course.
[They walk back left and find more girls at another umbrella.]
JUNPEI: Men, we've located a new target!
AKIHIKO: ......
JUNPEI: What are you waiting for, Akihiko-san? Show us how it's done.
AKIHIKO: ...Just keep your mouth shut.
GIRL IN BLACK: Hey, Nobuko. Are they staring at us?
NOBUKO: Yeah, I think so. Wow, Yoshie, you can see from there?
AKIHIKO: ...That's my cue.
[They walk over to the girls.]
AKIHIKO: H-Hi. S-Sorry to bother you, but I wanted to ask you something...
YOSHIE: ...Yes?
AKIHIKO: Um... Are you here alone?
NOBUKO: Are you hitting on us?
AKIHIKO: N-No, not at all... We just thought that if you're bored, you might
wanna talk... We could get to know each other better.
YOSHIE: Um, that's what it means to hit on someone. Don't you know...? It's so
lame to hit on girls at the beach...
NOBUKO: We were bored anyway, so why don't we just play along? Hey, you guys
are kinda cute.
YOSHIE: Nobuko!
NOBUKO: Hey, how old do you think we are?
MAIN: 
YOSHIE: Are you blind? Do we look that immature!?
NOBUKO: It's okay. They were just trying to be nice. It's been a while
since we graduated from high school...
NOBUKO: Seriously? We look that young? Wow, you made my day... even
though I know you're just trying to flatter us. To tell you the
truth, we're older than that...
AKIHIKO: Oh, really? That's too ba--
JUNPEI: Dude, wait! Don't you know that older women are more experienced!?
They're like fine wines!
YOSHIE: You're a pretty smooth talker for someone so young. How old are you
guys, anyway?
JUNPEI: We're in high school.
AKIHIKO: I'll be graduating next year.
NOBUKO: That's a bummer... We're not astrologically compatible...
YOSHIE: Look, it isn't gonna happen, so just give it up. You don't even seem
like you're having fun talking to us.
MAIN: 
NOBUKO: ...Or so you say. We don't even have anything to talk about...
except work... and that's just complaints.
AKIHIKO: Well, that might be interesting...
YOSHIE: You're not very good at lying, are you? You don't have to
pretend to be interested.
NOBUKO: Come on, Yoshie, give him a break... He said he's interested,
right?
YOSHIE: What!? Boring!?  I can't believe you said that...
NOBUKO: I'm sure he was just joking.
YOSHIE: Why are you being so nice to them, Nobuko!?
NOBUKO: Are you kidding? When was the last time we were hit on?
YOSHIE: Hey, let's head back... They're waiting for us.
JUNPEI: Th-They? ...You mean, you have boyfriends?
NOBUKO: Oh, yeah, sorry. Did we forget to mention that? Well, gotta go. We're
having a barbeque at the villa. You can come if you want.
AKIHIKO: ...Uh, n-no thanks.
YOSHIE: See ya.
[They leave.]
JUNPEI: Senpai! What the heck just happened!? Man, we looked like a bunch of
idiots!
AKIHIKO: ......
JUNPEI: Dude, you were his wing man! Where was the support? You let
them slip through our fingers! Seriously! Get your act together, man!
Next time, I want results!
[The guys walk back across the beach, and spot a woman sitting by herself.]
AKIHIKO: She's all alone, huh... Kind of strange, don't you think?
JUNPEI: Well, what are we waiting for?
[They move over to her.]
JUNPEI: Excuse me, miss...
BEAUTIFUL LADY: Yes?
MAIN: 
BEAUTIFUL LADY: ...Busy? Not at all. In fact, I could use some company.
BEAUTIFUL LADY: ...Yes, I'm completely alone. By "alone" I mean
"single."
BEAUTIFUL LADY: Incidentally, I saw you hitting on those girls. How'd it go?
MAIN: 
BEAUTIFUL LADY: Oh, really? Don't give up, boys. You have to be
persistant.
BEAUTIFUL LADY: Oh, really? That's a shame. Have you considered any...
alternative approaches?
JUNPEI: We tried to be heroes, but ended up zeroes.
AKIHIKO: Do you have to say it like that?
BEAUTIFUL LADY: Hahahahaha! That's so stupid it's funny!
JUNPEI: H-Hey, that's not my "A" material...
BEAUTIFUL LADY: How do you expect to get a girl with that kind of attitude?
You boys have no balls.
MAIN: 
BEAUTIFUL LADY: Yes, don't be shy. Embrace the unknown...
BEAUTIFUL LADY: You heard me. Don't be shy. Embrace the unknown...
BEAUTIFUL LADY: Be open to the possibilities... Especially you, you cute young
thing...
JUNPEI: M-Me?
BEAUTIFUL LADY: Yes, you. I can tell you lack experience.  And
you... You're a handsome fella... but even more timid.
AKIHIKO: H-How'd you know?
BEAUTIFUL LADY: Well, if you'd like... I'd be happy to show you a thing or
two...
JUNPEI: S-Seriously!?
BEAUTIFUL LADY: I'll teach you how to treat a lady right... Tee-hee.
JUNPEI: I'm in!
BEAUTIFUL LADY: But... I don't know if I can handle all three of you, so...
Who will it be?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Hey! This was my idea in the first place! Why do you get to
have all the fun!?  Forget him! Pick me! I'll show you
I've got balls!
BEAUTIFUL LADY: Tee-hee, just what I'm looking for in a man...
JUNPEI: Y-Yeah! ...I'm the one! Sorry, Senpai!
AKIHIKO: Hey, wait...
JUNPEI: Whaaaat!? Are you trying to ruin my summer of love!?
AKIHIKO: Uh, isn't that hair on your chin?
JUNPEI: That's right. I'm the only one who's worthy! I'll show you that
I've got balls!
BEAUTIFUL LADY: Tee-hee, then I'm sure we'll have fun.
AKIHIKO: Hey, wait...
JUNPEI: Whaaaat!? Are you trying to ruin my summer of love!?
AKIHIKO: Uh, isn't that hair on your chin?
AKIHIKO: M-Me...? B-but... ...... There's something I need to ask...
BEAUTIFUL LADY: Yes, darling?
AKIHIKO: Uh, isn't that hair on your chin?
BEAUTIFUL LADY: ...!? I-I missed a spot!?
AKIHIKO: Uh... Are you a...?
Beautiful Lady?:  There goes my chance... I was so close to snagging
myself a little boy-toy.
JUNPEI: ...Y-Ya mean, SHE's a HE!?
Beautiful Lady?: I guess you fellas aren't quite ready for a woman like me...
If you decide you want to try something a little spicier, then
you know where to find me. Tee-hee.
[A few minutes later, the guys are alone on the beach.]
JUNPEI: This sucks... We're 0 for 3...
AKIHIKO: 
JUNPEI: What's wrong? I thought you weren't interested in picking up chicks.
AKIHIKO: If I'm in a match, I want to win. I know what our problem is... You
can't control yourself.
JUNPEI: What!? Don't blame this on me!
AKIHIKO: I'm just stating the obvious.
JUNPEI: B-But, you haven't scored either!
AKIHIKO: What did you just say...?
AKIHIKO: Enough already! Leader, whose fault do you think it is?
MAIN: 
AKIHIKO: Hmph, just as I thought...
JUNPEI: Traitor! Anyways, what the hell do you... know... about...
AKIHIKO: That's ridiculous!
JUNPEI: Yes! You're absolutely right! The leader has spoken...
AKIHIKO: I won't accept a stalemate! It's either him or me!
JUNPEI: Yeah! This is serious... now, tell us... who's...
AKIHIKO: What's the matter? ...You see something?
[Everyone turns to look.]
[A strange-looking girl in a blue dress is standing on the dock.]
[The guys are hiding behind some rocks, looking at the girl.]
JUNPEI: Whoa... Talk about saving the best for last...! Now that's what I'm
talkin' about! Man, she's cute...
AKIHIKO: I agree...
JUNPEI: This is our last chance to make up for failures... But this time we
should try one-by-one instead of all together. We'll have a better shot
that way.
AKIHIKO: Sounds like a good plan.
JUNPEI: Alright, then let's decide the order! We'll go clockwise, starting with
the winner. Ready...? Rock, paper, scissors!
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Yeah, I win! Okay, I'll go first, Akihiko-san will go second, and
you'll go last. I'm up! Wish me luck!
[Junpei slowly walks over to the girl on the dock.]
JUNPEI: H-Hey, h-how's it going? I noticed you've been, uh, staring at the
ocean. So, um... do you come here often? My name's Ju-Ju-Junpei.
MYSTERIOUS GIRL: ...Ju-Ju-Junpei?
JUNPEI: Don't worry, I-I just want to talk. I mean, it's more fun than standing
here all by yourself, isn't it?
MYSTERIOUS GIRL: ...I am looking for a human.
[Junpei looks around.]
JUNPEI: O-Oh yeah...?
MYSTERIOUS GIRL: You are not the one.
AKIHIKO: Wow, he got shot down faster than I expected...
[Junpei moves back over to the other guys.]
JUNPEI: Sh-She's a tough one, Senpai...
AKIHIKO: Heh... Don't worry about me.
[Akihiko walks over to the girl.]
AKIHIKO: Well, hello there. Say, do you like the ocean?
MYSTERIOUS GIRL: Is your question directed at me?
AKIHIKO: Oh, um, yeah, I like the ocean, too. Hey, I heard that triathletes who
train at the beach perform better than those who practice indoors.
Makes sense, doesn't it?
JUNPEI: Wow, he's actually having a conversation with her! Although,
something's not right...
MYSTERIOUS GIRL: That type of information is irrelevant to me.
[Akihiko walks back to the guys.]
AKIHIKO: Heh, I won... I talked to her longer than you did.
JUNPEI: It doesn't matter how long you talked to her! ......  This
sucks...
AKIHIKO: Hey, stop crying! You're making me feel bad...
JUNPEI: ...So, that's our status. If you can't pull this off, I'm
gonna be traumatized for the rest of my life.
AKIHIKO: We're on the ropes, but it's not over yet... It's all up to you now.
[Main hesitates, but Junpei and Akihiko egg him on and he moves over to the
girl.]
MAIN: 
MYSTERIOUS GIRL: ......
JUNPEI: I couldn't hear what he said... But she looks surprised... We should go
over there.
MYSTERIOUS GIRL: You are...
[Junpei and Akihiko come out from behind the rocks.]
MYSTERIOUS GIRL: Initiating evasive maneuver. Confirmation must be made at a
secure location...
[She steps around Main and flees into the forest.]
JUNPEI: Hey, what did you say to make her run away like that? Well, what're you
waiting for? Go after her!
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Go tell her you're sorry! If you don't, we'll all be in trouble! Go on,
man. You can catch her if you hurry!
[Main follows her into the forest. He pursues her until she hides behind a sign
at a large tree.]
[She sticks her head out.]
MAIN: 
MYSTERIOUS GIRL: I was correct... I have found you.
MYSTERIOUS GIRL: Now I am certain... I have found you.
[She runs over to him.]
MYSTERIOUS GIRL: I have been searching for you. My highest priority is to be
with you!
[Junpei and Akihiko finally catch up.]
JUNPEI: WHAT!? I can't believe this!
AKIHIKO: What's going on...!? He didn't even say anything to her!
[The girls enter.]
YUKARI: There you guys are! What are you doing here!? We've been looking all
over for you!
FUUKA: Um... What're you doing in the middle of the woods, in your
swimsuits...?
YUKARI: You have no idea what we've-- Huh!?
[She notices the mysterious girl.]
YUKARI: Who's this?
MITSURU: Listen, we've encountered a problem. I'm sorry to interrupt your
vacation, but I need you all to go back to the house and prepare for
battle.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: That won't be necessary... We've found what we were looking
for.
[Ikutsuki enters.]
YUKARI: What do you mean?
[He walks over to the mysterious girl.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: You had me worried. You don't have permission to leave
the lab on your own, Aigis.

=== EVENING ===

[Everyone is back at the house.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I apologize for all the trouble. Everything is under control
now.
FUUKA: So, what happened to capturing the tank?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Oh, that's been taken care of. Come here, Aigis.
[The mysterious girl, now clearly shown to be a robot, walks in.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: This is Aigis. As you can see, she's a "mechanical maiden."
AIGIS: I am Aigis. My mission is to destroy Shadows. I have been assigned to
SEES, effective immediately.
YUKARI: No way... It's like she's... alive.
AKIHIKO: This is unbelievable...
JUNPEI: She's so cute, but... she's a robot...
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Anti-Shadow weapons were created ten years ago to combat
uncontrollable Shadows. Aigis was the last to be made... and
she's the only one that still remains today.
MITSURU: An Anti-Shadow weapon... Does that mean she...?
AIGIS: Yes, I am capable of operating the Persona "Palladion."
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: She suffered major damage in combat and has remained in the lab
ever since. It's still unclear as to why she suddenly
reactivated herself this morning... Well, I hope you will all
get along.
FUUKA: An Anti-Shadow weapon with a will of her own... This is amazing!
YUKARI: Um... By the way... When I saw you earlier, it seemed like you knew
him...
AIGIS: Yes, it is very important for me to be by his side.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Hmm... Perhaps her identification system is malfunctioning...
Or maybe she's still half-asleep... This is quite
interesting... Hmm... Well, I can ponder this later. Oh, I
forgot to tell you all... You can participate in a wide range
of recreational activities here. There's a tennis court, a
pool table... even a karaoke machine. Would you care to hear
me sing?

=== DAYTIME ===

[The guys are on the beach again.]
JUNPEI: Man, it's already the third day of our trip. It's too bad we have to go
home tomorrow... I'd totally stay longer if I could. But, I can't
complain... A lot of cool things happened while we were here.
[He looks around and runs off somewhere.]
AKIHIKO: ...How can he be so full of energy? We were all up so late last
night...
[Junpei comes back while Aigis and the girls enter. Aigis walks over to
Junpei.]
AIGIS: Do we have a mission at the beach today?
JUNPEI: Nah, it's nothing like that. We just came here to have some fun.
FUUKA: Do you understand what it means to "have fun," Aigis?
AIGIS: Of course. Recreation is the refreshment of one's mind and body.
JUNPEI: Exactly! Wow, you sure know a lot about us humans. Alright, let's take
one last dip before we leave!
[Junpei goes into the water and Aigis follows after him.]
FUUKA: Uh, hold on, Junpei-kun... Is it okay for Aigis to go in the ocean?
YUKARI: Oh, I'm sure she's water-proof.
[Aigis comes back onto the beach.]
FUUKA: What's wrong, Aigis?
AIGIS: It is best that we all engage in this activity together. An activity in
which only one person derives enjoyment is not the optimal method to
"have fun."
YUKARI: Ugh, do we have to...?
[Yukari and Aigis head into the water.]
FUUKA: We should join them.
MITSURU: Okay.
[Fuuka and Mitsuru enter the water as well. Ikutsuki arrives and walks over to
Main and Akihiko under the umbrella.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Are you enjoying yourself? We've been quite busy during our
time here, but it looks as if we can relax a bit today.
JUNPEI: Hey, Akihiko-san, c'mon! It's your turn!
AKIHIKO: My turn...? What are they doing?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I'm glad to see everyone is having so much fun. I've
already told you what time the ship will be arriving tomorrow,
yes? I'll most likely head over to the port early, so don't be
late.
AKIHIKO: Okay, I'll let everyone know.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Until then, enjoy the last day of your vacation.
[Fool Arcana to rank 5.]

=== EVENING ===

[Shinjiro and the punks are hanging out behind Port Island Station.]
PUNK: Oh shit, it's them...
TOUGH CHICK: You mean those three? Wow, they're freaky!
PUNK: Shut up! Let's go!
[All the punks leave as the group that attacked the teenager before arrives.]
SHINJIRO: Hey.
PALE YOUNG MAN: Why do they always run and hide when I approach? They're like
back alley rats.
SHINJIRO: ...Beats me.
PALE YOUNG MAN: Jin... Give him the capsules.
[The other man takes something from his pocket and gives it to Shinjiro.]
SHINJIRO: ...Thanks.
[Shinjiro gets up and begins to walk away.]
SHINJIRO: I'll pay you the same as--
Smart-looking guy: Hold up.
PALE YOUNG MAN: This time, information will suffice. Your acquaintances have
been busy lately. I'm referring to their activites on nights
when the moon is full. They've spent a great deal of time in
the tower as well. Why did they take this burden upon
themselves?
SHINJIRO: ......
PALE YOUNG MAN: You do know, don't you? ...But, you don't wish to say? Is it
because they are your friends?
SHINJIRO: No! I've got nothing to do with them.
PALE YOUNG MAN: Then, tell us.
SHINJIRO: Tch... I don't know the details, but... Supposedly, if you destroy
all those creatures... then the tower will disapear, and with it, the
Dark Hour.
PALE YOUNG MAN: You mean... they intend to eliminate the Dark Hour?
SHINJIRO: Y-Yeah... Why?
PALE YOUNG MAN: Why would they do such a thing!? With the power they have...
They wish to destroy the Tower of Demise as well!?
SHINJIRO: Tower of Demise...? ...Who wouldn't wanna take out that damn tower?
Smart-looking Guy: Easy, Takaya...
PALE YOUNG MAN: ...Yes, yes.
[The three of them leave.]
SHINJIRO: Hmph... I can't go back... Not after what happened.
[Meanwhile, the party is back at the dorm.]
JUNPEI: Man, I'm beat... It seemed to take forever to get back...
FUUKA: Yeah, it was a tiring trip. Please rest up so you're ready for the next
operation.
JUNPEI: Yeah, yeah. I don't have any plans for summer break, so I can fight
Shadows all you want.
YUKARI: ...Wow, you must really be bored.
JUNPEI: ...Sh-Shut up, Yuka-tan.
YUKARI: Whatever. We just have to defeat those last six, and it'll be all over.
The Lost will get better, and everything will be back to normal, right?
That's why we have to try our hardest.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

AIGIS: Good morning! Please wake up.
[Main wakes up to find Aigis standing next to his bed.]
AIGIS: Mission accomplished.
MAIN: 
AIGIS: My highest priority is to be by your side.
AIGIS: The paper on the wall says, "Do things five minutes early."
Therefore, I woke you up five minutes prior to the triggering of
your alarm clock.
AIGIS: It has not triggered yet. The paper on the wall says, "Do things
five minutes early." Therefore, I woke you up five minutes in
advance.
[There's a knock at the door.]
YUKARI: Hey, are you awake? That girl disappeared, and we can't find her
anywhere. Think you can help us out? She might've gone out on her own,
like she did in Yakushima...
AIGIS: I am not a girl... I am Aigis, and I am here.
YUKARI: Huh...?
[Aigis opens the door.]
YUKARI: Aigis!? How did you--
AIGIS: He was asleep, so I unlocked the door.
YUKARI: That's unlawful entry! Didn't we tell you to stay in the command room
at night!?
AIGIS: I propose to be on standby in this room from now on. Is this acceptable?
YUKARI: What!? N-No, it's not acceptable!
AIGIS: If there is a problem, then I will address it promptly.
YUKARI: Uh, the problem is it's against dorm regulations...  Well,
don't just sit there! Tell her!
MAIN: 
YUKARI: See? He agrees.
AIGIS: ...I will do as told.
YUKARI: H-Hey, don't say that! You know she can't stay with you!
YUKARI: Well, you should care! It's just not acceptable!
YUKARI: Tch... Alright, I'll have a room prepared for you on the third floor.
You can stay there. Oh, and don't leave the dorm by yourself, okay?
AIGIS: I will do as commanded.
YUKARI: I'm tired... I have practice this morning, so I gotta go...
[Yukari leaves.]
AIGIS: ...Everyone goes to a place called school in the morning. I comprehend.
[Aigis leaves as well.]
[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Junpei there.]
JUNPEI: S'up. ...Hey, I was thinkin'... After we defeat all the Shadows and the
Dark Hour disappears, what's gonna happen then?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Well, regular people don't even know about the Dark Hour,
right?
JUNPEI: Well, yeah, but... Regular people don't even know about the
Dark Hour, right?
JUNPEI: That means no one will ever know about anything we've done... That
kinda sucks, don't ya think?
[Main and Junpei enter the school.]

=== LUNCHTIME ===

STUDENT: Hey, the results are posted!
respect! Your Charm has increased. You suddenly remember something.
Mitsuru promised to give you a gift if you scored the highest.

=== EVENING ===

FUUKA: ...Hi, how was your day? So, how did you do on your exams?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: That's great! I'm happy for you.
FUUKA: I see... Well, it's only the first term, so you still have time
to improve.
FUUKA: Did you see Mitsuru-senpai's score? Wow, she's amazing.
AIGIS: ...In two weeks, the moon will be full again.
JUNPEI: Dude, those freaks with Apathy Syndrome will be everywhere... Wait, I
mean "The Lost." I prolly shouldn't complain about 'em, since it's not
their fault. It's those damn Shadows...
AIGIS: It is possible to end this... Six Shadows remain. If we can eliminate
them, the Dark Hour will vanish.
JUNPEI: Yeah, that's true... So, what you're trying to say, Aigis, is that
fighting is more important that studying, right? ...I agree 100%!

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Junpei there.]
JUNPEI: Dude, summer break starts tomorrow! It's time to meet some cuties at
the beach! Ya know, if you think about it, we're pretty lucky to be
living in the dorm... Mitsuru-senpai, Yuka-tan, and Fuuka... They're
all hotties, don't ya think?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Yeah, but it'd be tough to be more than just friends with any
of 'em...
JUNPEI: Hey, c'mon, dude! Be honest! This is guy talk! But ya know,
it'd be tough to be more than friends with any of 'em...
JUNPEI: Senpai is the smartest girl in school and the President of Student
Council... I bet she only dates uber-nerds. Yuka-tan is pretty damn
popular, so she could prolly get any guy she wants... And that just
leaves Fuuka... But, she's super shy... You'd have to be really
careful... Hey, don't tell any of them I was talking about this,
alright!?
[Main and Junpei enter the school.]

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Main is in his homeroom. The coach enters and approaches him.]
COACH: Hey, Main. You got a minute? Since you're a transfer student, you
probably don't know about the upcoming competition, right? Well, on
August 2nd, there's a big tournament. I want you to compete, so start
training! You'll be going up against a monster named Hayase, but you can
handle it. This year, we won't lose so easily! Make sure you come to
school from July 27th to August 1st, alright? I'm gonna make you work
like you've never worked before, so be ready!
[The coach leaves.]

=== EVENING ===

[Shinjiro and the punks are in the back alley again. The punks run off as the
group from the other night returns.]
TAKAYA: Good evening. I'm glad to see that you're well.
[Jin gives Shinjiro more pills.]
TAKAYA: Incidentally, I see that they've again added a new ally to their ranks.
...Well, I suppose it's more of a pet than an ally.
SHINJIRO: Makes no difference to me.
TAKAYA: It seems that what you told us before about their intentions was true.
How lamentable... Now, we have no choice but to intervene. It is up to
each individual how he will use the strength granted him... But, to
erase the Dark Hour would be denying the very power they possess. We
cannot tolerate that.
SHINJIRO: Do whatever you want...
[Shinjiro starts to walk away.]
JIN: Hold it. ...What're you gonna do? I know they asked you to come back.
SHINJIRO: You're startin' to piss me off.
JIN: They're goin' down, ya hear me? And if you're on their side, then you're
going down too.
SHINJIRO: Like I said before... it doesn't concern me.
[He walks off. Meanwhile, Main is at the dorm.]
KEN: ...Hello! My name is Ken Amada. I'll be staying here for a while. I'll try
to stay out of everyone's way, so don't mind me.

=== EARLY MORNING ===


=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

get going...

=== DAYTIME ===

on August 2nd.
YUKO: Hey! No slacking off! You won't win a point off of Mamoru Hayase like
that!

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? So, how was practice, bro?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: ...Oh, yeah? You're tougher than I thought.
JUNPEI: Dude, don't push yourself too hard.
JUNPEI: ...If you think you can handle it, let's go to Tartarus tonight. We
have less than two weeks to get ready, and I'm sure the next Shadow
will be stronger than the last one...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

get going...

=== DAYTIME ===

on August 2nd. Your body feels light... but you're having trouble winning a
point...

=== EVENING ===

MITSURU: Welcome back. ...Apathy Syndrome is on the rise again, huh? People
seem to have calmed down a bit, despite the media... But, there will
be serious problems if we don't end this. We must defeat the last six
Shadows, beginning with the one we anticipate on the next full moon.
If the number of The Lost continues to increase, this city will fall
into chaos. I don't even want to imagine what that might be like...
JUNPEI: Y-You're just exaggerating, right? ...Then again, maybe not.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

get going...

=== DAYTIME ===

on August 2nd.
YUKO: Okay, this is your last chance! Show me what you've got! You gotta beat
Mamoru! This is our year!

=== EVENING ===

FUUKA: ...Hi, how was your day? Mitsuru-senpai is not back yet... She said
she'd be here by midnight. ...Maybe we shouldn't go to Tartarus tonight.

=== DARK HOUR ===

[Main is asleep in his bed.]
FUUKA: Sorry to wake you! I detect a Shadow! Please hurry to
the 4th floor!
[Everyone gathers in the control room.]
JUNPEI: What's going on!?
MITSURU: There's a Shadow in the city. Yamagishi found it by chance.
YUKARI: But... the moon isn't full yet...
FUUKA: Actually, it seems to be just a normal Shadow. However, it IS outside
of Tartarus...
MITSURU: It's near Naganaki Shrine. Akihiko went ahead since he was in the
vicinity. I'm sure he can handle it alone, but let's get ready just
in case.
JUNPEI: Gotcha!
[The console beeps.]
FUUKA: Yes, this is Fuuka.
AKIHIKO: I'm here. Sorry, but I think you guys better come,
right away.
MITSURU: What's wrong? Is it a powerful one!?
AKIHIKO: No, the Shadow's been defeated. In fact, it was
already defeated when I got here.
MITSURU: What happened?
AKIHIKO: The little fella's been injured... I wanna save him
if we can.
YUKARI: "Little fella"? Who's he talking about?
JUNPEI: Beats me.
MITSURU: At any rate, let's go.
[They all head over to the shrine. Akihiko is there, and the dog Koromaru is
lying on the ground in a pool of blood.]
FUUKA: Koro-chan! Are you okay, Koro-chan!?
MITSURU: You know this dog?
YUKARI: Yeah, everyone around here does... We have to help him!
MITSURU: First, we must stop the bleeding.
AKIHIKO: Man... He's one tough fighter. He defeated that Shadow all by himself.
JUNPEI: Wait, does that mean... this dog's a Persona-user!?
AIGIS: He says, "This is a place of peace, so I protected it."
[Everyone notices some flowers leaning next to the gate.]
FUUKA: Those flowers... They must be for the priest who died in the accident.
YUKARI: So, he really was guarding this place...
JUNPEI: Uh, Aigis? Don't tell me you can translate dog language too...
AIGIS: Canines do not have their own language. However, speech is not the only
means of communication.
AKIHIKO: This fella really is a rare breed.
AIGIS: Confirmed.
JUNPEI: ...He's not the only one.
MITSURU: Alright, let's report to the Chairman, so we can conclude this
mission. As for a vet... It may be midnight, but I believe I can
arrange for one.
YUKARI: Good job, boy. You're one amazing dog...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

get going...

=== DAYTIME ===

on August 2nd.
YUKO: Great hit, Main-kun! Keep it up! You can do it!

=== EVENING ===

FUUKA: ...Hi, how was your day? One more week until the moon is full again...
Unfortunately, the number of victims has been increasing lately. Let's
do our best to stop it!

=== DARK HOUR ===

PHAROS: Good evening.
[Main and Pharos are in Main's room again.]
PHAROS: It's becoming quite lively around you. So, how are you getting along
with the others?
MAIN: 
PHAROS: I'm glad to hear that.
PHAROS: They put their lives in your hands, and you in theirs. You
should have more respect for them.
PHAROS: ...It is one week until the next full moon. Are you prepared...? To be
honest, I'm not too worried about you... However, you should still
remain cautious.
[He disappears and reappears at the foot of the bed.]
PHAROS: I'll come to see you again.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

get going...

=== DAYTIME ===

on August 2nd. You got a clean hit! Your confidence is soaring! The
tournament is the day after tomorrow...

=== EVENING ===

YUKARI: ...Oh, hey. Have you looked around lately? The Lost are everywhere...
My friends get scared when they see them. People don't even feel safe
walking around town. We have to do something about it.

=== EARLY MORNING ===


=== DAYTIME ===

on August 2nd.
YUKO: Stay focused! The tournament is tomorrow! You're doing great, Main-kun!
You've beaten everyone on the team! I'll be rooting for you! Good luck!

=== EVENING ===

AKIHIKO: ...Where have you been? I hear you'll be competing in the tournament
tomorrow... Well, you better win. ...Watch out for Mamoru, though.
He's a tough competitor.
JUNPEI: Hey, I've heard that name before... He's pretty famous, bro. I saw him
in a sports magazine. Dude, guys like him are insane... You're gonna
get your ass handed to you on a platter, so what's the point? Well, I
guess the full moon is coming up soon, so you can think of it as
training.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

going...

=== DAYTIME ===

[Main, Kazushi, and Yuko are in the stands at the stadium.]
ceremony has begun.
ATHLETE: We pledge... to compete fairly and uphold the ideals of good
sportsmanship!
of the crowd fills the air, as the participants put their hearts into
competing. Soon, it will be your turn.
KAZUSHI: Hey, you're almost up, Main! You ready to do this!?
MAIN: 
KAZUSHI: That's what I like to hear! Now, since this is your first
time, let me give you some advice...
KAZUSHI: Yeah, I thought you might be. But don't worry, man! Everyone's
like that in the beginning. Let me give you some advice, since
this is your first time...
YUKO: Okay! Leave the cheering to me! Oh, yeah... Here, take this,
Main-kun. It's my Special Drink. If you use it, you won't be
tired anymore.
KAZUSHI: Since this is your first big event, let me give you some
advice.
KAZUSHI: Just give it everything you've got! It takes guts to win! Don't give
in to fear!
[Main gets up and walks off to get ready.]
KAZUSHI: Alright, dude! Go for it!!
[Main is now participating in the competition.]
YUKO: Wow, he's good! Keep it up, Main-kun!!
KAZUSHI: Whoa! Dude!
vacation.
[The screen fades out.]
[Main is back in the stands with Kazushi and Yuko.]
YUKO: Main-kun! You did it!
KAZUSHI: You did great, dude! Looks like all your hard work paid off.
YUKO: But... It's too bad HE won again.
KAZUSHI: They say Hayase annihilates his opponents. I thought people were just
exaggerating, but man, he's insane! We could sure use someone like him
on our team... Aghhhh! Next time, we won't lose!
[Another athlete approaches the trio.]
YUKO: Hey, isn't that him?
MAMORU HAYASE: Hey, what's up? Dude... you were good.
MAIN: 
MAMORU HAYASE: Yeah, I can tell.
MAMORU HAYASE: ...You put up a good fight.
MAMORU HAYASE: Hey, I was thinking... Maybe we could hang out sometime...
MAIN: 
MAMORU HAYASE: Cool. You still need to work on your technique, but if
you keep at it, you could be really great. I think you
might help push me to test my limits.
MAMORU HAYASE: You still need to work on your technique, but if you
keep at it, you could be really great. I think you might
help push me to test my limits. That's why.
MAMORU HAYASE: I usually grab a bite to eat at the strip mall in Iwatodai after
school... Stop by sometime if you feel like it. My name's
Mamoru... Nice to meet you.
MAMORU HAYASE: See ya around.
[He walks away.]
YUKO: Wow, Main-kun! He must really be impressed with you!
KAZUSHI: Hmph! If you see him again... tell him this... Next time, I'll kick
his ass!
YUKO: Calm down, Kaz. Good job today, Main-kun!
KAZUSHI: Let's get outta here.

=== EVENING ===

MITSURU: Welcome back. I heard from Akihiko that you did well in the
tournament.
MAIN: 
MITSURU: It's quite impressive, considering you've also had the Shadows to
contend with.
YUKARI: That's great, Main-kun! Not like SOMEONE I know, who doesn't
participate in any activities...
JUNPEI: Blah, blah, blah... Here we go again... Anyway, we have more important
things to worry about... It'll be a full moon soon, right?
AKIHIKO: Yeah, next Thursday, the 6th. Make sure you're ready.

=== EARLY MORNING ===


=== EVENING ===

FUUKA: ...Hi, how was your day? This Thursday, the 6th, there will be a full
moon. I'm sure a Shadow will appear as well. Please be ready.

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? The day after tomorrow is the big day, huh? Let's kick
some ass, man!

=== EVENING ===

YUKARI: ...Oh, hey. Tomorrow is the day... Are you ready?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Me too. Let's do our best!
YUKARI: Well, you don't seem nervous. By the way, if you wanna go to
Tartarus, I'll come along.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

to stay home today and conserve your strength.

=== DARK HOUR ===

[Everyone is in the meeting room.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Well, it's a full moon once again.
MITSURU: Any luck, Yamagishi?
FUUKA: Yes, I've located it... and this time, it's not just an ordinary one.
AKIHIKO: Now, that's more like it.
FUUKA: It's by the deserted houses in the northern part of Iwatodai. But, there
is one thing that's strange... It seems like it's underground... almost
10 meters.
YUKARI: It must be in some kind of basement...
AIGIS: According to my records, there is no structure in the area that matches
those criteria. However, in the past there was an underground facility
that was used by the military.
YUKARI: The military? ...Is that true?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Well, the architectural and geographic data for the area were
uploaded into her memory bank. Then again, the information
hasn't been updated in a decade.
AIGIS: That is correct.
JUNPEI: Uh, wouldn't that be a good idea?
AKIHIKO: So, how should we interpret this?
FUUKA: There's no way of knowing without actually going there...
MITSURU: It seems war's scars may be deeper than we think... The situation is
still unclear at this time. Therefore, we will wait until we arrive to
determine who should be deployed.
AKIHIKO: Agreed.
AIGIS: Understood.
MITSURU: Then, let's go.
[The scene fades out.]
[The group enters the facility through a large gate.]
FUUKA: The target should be around here...
[Everyone looks around.]
TAKAYA: Well done...
[The group turns around. Takaya and Jin enter through the gate.]
TAKAYA: This is the first time we've met in person.
FUUKA: Who are these guys!? Lucia didn't sense a thing 'til now!
TAKAYA: My name is Takaya. This is Jin. We are known to some as Strega. We've
been keeping an eye on you... From what we hear, you've undertaken a
"righteous" battle to save the world. But, we've come here tonight to
put an end to that dream. You've gained new allies, yet this land
still crawls with sin. Tartarus is towering as beautifully as always...
JUNPEI: But, why the hell would you wanna stop us!?
JIN: Simple... If the Shadows and the Dark Hour disappear, then so will our
power. ...And we can't let that happen, now can we?
MITSURU: Power...? Don't tell me you're Persona-users as well!
TAKAYA: Why don't you use that pretty little head of yours for a change? Only
a select few wield the power of a Persona... And the Dark Hour is a
frontier that is ours alone to explore... just like the Tower of
Demise...
YUKARI: THAT's your reason!? ...Are you crazy!? There's no telling what will
happen if we don't do something about the Shadows!
TAKAYA: What difference does it make...? There will always be disasters,
whether they are caused by Shadows or arise from human folly. No one
can predict the future, anyway. But, that is all beside the point...
Surely you will acknowledge the sense of significance the Dark Hour has
given you.
YUKARI: You think I like this!?
TAKAYA: Is it not so? How about the rest of you...? Do you also wish to return
to your pathetic, ordinary lives?
JUNPEI: ...Huh?
AKIHIKO: ......
FUUKA: I don't enjoy this one single bit.
JIN: You've each got your own reason for fighting. "Justice" is only an
excuse... And that makes you all hypocrites! So I say, to hell with you!
[Takaya and Jin walk back out; Jin kicks a switch.]
JIN: Have fun in there.
[The gate closes on the party; Akihiko bangs on the doors.]
AKIHIKO: Dammit!
AIGIS: We will be all right. Rather then wasting our energy, I suggest we deal
with the Shadow first.
YUKARI: You're right. If we lose our cool, then they win.
FUUKA: The Shadow's moving! I think it's noticed us!
MITSURU: Alright, let's concentrate on our original goal. We can look for a way
out after we've won. Everyone, prepare for battle.
[Main selects the other party members and heads deeper into the base.]
FUUKA: I sense the target two blocks ahead of you! It's
moving slowly downward. Chase after it!
[They move to the next area. Tread marks are on the ground here.]
FUUKA: Whoa... This place seems to have been some kind of
weapons depot. I've never seen so many weapons before... All designed to
kill... But, I guess that's the reality of war... It's hard to believe
that a time like that actually existed...
[They move to the next area. The tread marks continue into the tunnel.]
FUUKA: The target is gaining speed! It's continuing down the
tunnel. Chase after it!
[They move to the next area.]
FUUKA: The target has stopped! It's waiting in the next
area! Be careful!
[They reach the last area to find a large tank-like Shadow.]
FUUKA: This explains the tread marks... It's using the tank as
armor!
[The group begins fighting the Shadow.]
FUUKA: Its Arcana is Justice... Wait, it's Chariot? What the--
Why am I sensing two entities...? It doesn't make sense!
[After a while, the Shadow splits to reveal the turret and the tank are
seperate Shadows. The party manages to defeat both of them. Meanwhile,
Ikutsuki is sitting in the control room. The panel beeps.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Yes?
MITSURU: This is Mitsuru. We've neutralized the target.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Good work. You may return.
MITSURU: Wait. There's more... Our mission was interrupted by
an uninvited guest. ...He's most likely a Persona-user.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: A Persona-user!?
MITSURU: ...And he wasn't alone. They appeared quietly during
the Dark Hour and seemed to be aware of our activities.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Hmm... Did they say anything that might give us a clue?
MITSURU: Come to think of it... They said they're called
"Strega."
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Strega...? ...... I'll see what I can find out.
MITSURU: Thank you. I have one final thing to report... I
regret to inform you that we fell right into Strega's trap, and now
we're locked inside here.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Ah, I see. Since the threat has been eliminated, I'll send
someone over as soon as I can.
MITSURU: I'm sorry... We'll be waiting.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Other Persona-users, huh...? ......
[The scene fades out.]
between you all has grown... You learned a new tactic! You can now use "Same
Target!" ...... An unexpected enemy has emerged... They seem to be
Persona-users, as well. ...... In any case, you succeeded in defeating the
Shadow this month, too. You expect that there will be fewer vicitms for a
while. You are exhausted, so you're eager to get some rest...

=== EVENING ===

KEN: ...Hello!

=== DARK HOUR ===

PHAROS: Hi, how are you?
[Main and Pharos are in Main's room.]
PHAROS: I remembered something else... The end won't be brought about by anyone
in particular... It's coming because there are many people who wish for
it... as if it was destined from the start. But, doesn't that seem like
a strange thing to wish for?
MAIN: 
PHAROS: I see... Well, I suppose some people would choose death over
suffering. Otherwise, one might end up hating everything in
this world...
PHAROS: Are you certain? What about those who hope for an end to their
suffering, who wish to find peace?
PHAROS: Yeah, I guess there's no sense worrying about it at this point.
After all, even I don't fully understand the coming of the end.
PHAROS: Well, enough about that for now. There's something else I wanted to
tell you today... Soon, the poisonous flowers will bloom... One in
your own garden, and three in the garden opposite yours. I don't know
whether or not this has anything to do with the end, but you should be
careful.
[He disappears and reappears at the foot of the bed.]
PHAROS: I'll come again if I find out anything useful. That's what friends are
for, right?
[He vanishes. Death Arcana to rank 5.]

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main is watching TV in his room when his phone rings.]
VOICE ON THE PHONE: Hello? This is Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH: I'm calling to inform you of a change in Tartarus... I believe a
path that was blocked is now open... I thought you might like to
know. ...I wish you a safe journey.

=== DAYTIME ===

[Main is in his room. There's a knock at the door.]
MITSURU: It's me. I'm sorry to bother you while you're resting, but can I have
a word with you?
MAIN: 
[Main opens the door.]
MITSURU: Good morning. There's something I need to tell everyone... but
I think it would be best if you saw it for yourself. Come to
the 4th floor meeting room when you get home tonight, okay?
I'll see you then.
[She leaves.]
MITSURU: That's okay. Just listen through the door. There's something I
need to tell everyone, so come to the 4th floor meeting room
tonight, okay? That's it. Well, see you later.

=== EVENING ===

[Junpei and Aigis enter the meeting room.]
AIGIS: Does this mean we have a new mission?
JUNPEI: I dunno. But, the alarm's not ringin'...
[Yukari, Main, and Fuuka enter.]
YUKARI: Huh!?
FUUKA: Koro-chan!?
[They all run over to the table, where Koromaru, Mitsuru, and Akihiko are
standing. Koromaru has a collar on him.]
KOROMARU: Woof!
FUUKA: Are you okay!? ...Where'd you get this collar?
MITSURU: That collar is designed to help control his Persona. In other words,
it's an Evoker for dogs.
YUKARI: Wait... Does that mean he'll be going into battle?
MITSURU: It was a surprise for me as well. But according to the tests, it's
quite possible. In fact, it was the Chairman's suggestion. ...We'll be
looking after him here in the dorm.
FUUKA: Is that okay with you, Koro-chan?
KOROMARU: Woof!
AIGIS: He says, "I'll return the favor."
YUKARI: Man, you're one loyal dog.
KOROMARU: Woof!!
JUNPEI: Hey, make yourself at home... The more the merrier, right? Who cares if
you're a dog? Alright, I'll take him for a walk. It's summer break
after all!
MITSURU: Yes, it is. Enjoy your vacation while you can; summer classes start
next week. I'll see to it that you graduate.
JUNPEI: H-Hey... Good one, Senpai. You almost had me there.
MITSURU: Oh, it's no joke. We'll be taking intensive courses. I've already
applied for all of us. I know how difficult its's been balancing
school and our late night excursions. You haven't had much time to
study. I apologize for that. That's why the Chairman agrees that this
is a good idea. ...I thought I told Takeba and Yamagishi.
JUNPEI: Are you serious!? This is the first I've heard of it!
FUUKA: Um, sorry... I forgot to mention it.
JUNPEI: Aw, man!!
YUKARI: Hey, with your grades, you should be thanking her!
JUNPEI: Yeah, right.   This sucks. Don't you think?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: W-Well, it's only for a few weeks, so let's make the most of it...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

continues... Your Academics has increased.

=== DAYTIME ===

MR. EDOGAWA: I know it's hot, everyone, but let's just try and get through
class. Focus pocus! You must all be very curious students to be
taking this course over the summer. ...I'm not really sure what to
make of that. Eeeheehee... Well, let's talk about something
interesting today. All you future magicians will want to pay close
attention... Eeeheehee... Today's subject is Tarot. That's right,
those cards often used in fortune-telling. Originating in 15th
century Europe as normal playing cards, tarot cards evolved into
tools of divination. A variety of different versions of tarot card
decks exist, including the Marseille and Rider decks... But today,
in respect of the great magician Crowley, we will be using the
Thoth deck. First, let's talk about the composition of the deck...
The modern 78-card tarot deck is divided into two parts. There are
22 Major Arcana--the face cards--and 56 Minor Arcana, or number
cards... The Minor Arcana are also sometimes called pips. The
Major Arcana feature a variety of illustrations on their faces.
Beginning with "The Fool" and ending with "The World"... they tell
a story in numerical order that is a metaphor of an individual's
journey through life. Each Major Arcana represents a stage on that
journey... an experience that the individual must incorporate to
realize his oneness. They are all important, so let's take a look
at each of the 22 cards, one by one.
The first card, numbered 0, is The Fool. It represents the
beginning and suggests infinite possibilities.
The next card, The Magician, represents action and initiative...
but also immaturity.
The Priestess represents contemplation and inner knowledge.
The Empress represents motherhood and the life it brings forth.
The Emperor is an opposing card. It represents fathering and
relates to leadership and decision-making skills.
The Hierophant represents formality and knowledge, and stands for
religion.
The Lovers card represents choice. Here, the individual's
consciousness has finally surfaced.
The Chariot represents victory for the individual, but only a
momentary one.
Justice represents the knowledge of what is right, and what is
wrong.
The Hermit represents the individual's search for answers by
looking inward, deep inside his heart.
Fortune represents fate, and the opportunities that come with it.
Strength represents both passion and self-control. It is depicted
as power with reason.
The Hanged Man reflects the individual's inability to take action.
Spiritual death awaits the individual with the 13th card, which is
aptly named Death. Death is considered a transitional card... The
old ends, and the new begins. Now, let us continue along the path,
following the transition.
Temperance is the balancing of opposites. Opening his eyes to the
world allows the individual to grow...
And as the Devil represents, he then faces temptation...
At The Tower, his values collapse on him. It seems as if he no
longer has anything to believe in, but...
...he then finds a glimmer of hope, represented by The Star; and
he is suffused with a serene calm.
This bliss makes him vulnerable to the illusions of The Moon.
Fears arise, and he follows the dim path in his heart with
trepidation...
But he is rewarded with a bright future, represented by The Sun,
which signifies true achievement.
Judgement awaits the individual at the end of his journey, as he
looks back on the path he has traveled.
The final card is The World, which represents the individual's
full awareness of his place in the world.
That is the growth of an individual as explained by the tarot
cards. ...Perhaps all this talk about life doesn't hit home with
you young folks just yet, hm? Eeeheehee... Now, you can use all 78
cards to divine the future in detail... but most people only use
the 22 Major Arcana. Okay. Next, let's talk about how to tell
fortunes using the Major Arcana. First, you will need to shuffle
the cards. If a card is reversed, its meaning will change, so it's
important...

MR. EDOGAWA: Now, let's begin. Yod-he-vav-he... How are you all handling the
heat? ...I could brew you some of my special tea if you'd like.
Eeeheehee... Now, let's continue with our special summer study--
The Truth Behind Magic. I'll be talking about "Kabbalah." I
assume all of you have at least heard of Kabbalah, yes? It is
known as the mystical study of the Hebrew scriptures, but... as I
have mentioned before, it has had a great impact on western
sorcery. It has been said that to learn the secrets of magic,
first you must truly understand Kabbalah. So, who was the person
who formed this incredible ideology known as Kabbalah? Well,
according to legend, it was Moses. Yes, THAT Moses. The Moses who
gave us the Ten Commandments and split the Red Sea. But in
reality, it was formulated by a group of rabbis long, long ago.
However, because it consists of such a complicated coded system...
Kabbalah did not become known to the western world until much
later. Now, it is important to note that there are many different
ancient methods of deciphering Kabbalah. For example, there is
"Gematria," the interpretatioin of text by replacing letters with
the numbers they represent. There is "Notarikon," where you take a
letter from each word to form another sentence or thought. There
is also "Temurah," a method where letters of words are replaced,
thereby giving the sentence a new meaning. All these different
methods make it difficult to fully comprehend Kabbalah. Now, one
of the most important ideas of Kabbalah is the Tree of Life,
formed of the ten Sefirot. Most illustrations depict it as a chart
shaped like a tree. The 10 stages represented by the Sefirot...
and the 22 paths connecting them represent the stages of Creation
God formed from his own self, as well as the direction in which
humanity should evolve. Where did we come from? Where are we
going? These answers lie in the Sefirot. When training your magic,
it's important to picture the Sefirot every so often. And when you
are meditating, you should focus on the Sefirot as well. If life
was a test, the Sefirot would be the basic questions. All aspiring
magicians should know them. So, if you're looking for inspiration,
try your hand at the Sefirot. Eeeheehee... By the way, did you
all notice that I said there were 22 paths? Yes, that's right.
The same number as the Major Arcana I spoke about earlier.
Eeeheehee... Now, continuing on, according to the Sefirot, the
world is broken up into four stages...

down...
[Main walks forward a few steps and stops near the mask stall.]
AIGIS: What is that?
MITSURU: It's called a "mask." You wear it over your face to have fun.
AIGIS: Hiding your face is fun?
MITSURU: The purpose is not to hide your face. Rather, you wear it to have a
different face. Hmm... It's difficult to explain...
AIGIS: You try to be someone else by wearing a different face...?
MITSURU: Yes, exactly. ...Your degree of comprehension is simply amazing. At
this rate, after a few more tests the Chairman may give you permission
to go out.
AIGIS: I am looking forward to that.
MAIN: 
[Main puts his arm up in greeting; Mitsuru and Aigis don't respond.]
[They walk off; Main puts his arm back down.]
[Mitsuru and Aigis walk away.]
while, you decided to go back to the dorm.

YUKARI: ...Oh, hey. It's sooo hot... I hate this weather... Don't you agree?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Seriously? How can you not be hot?
YUKARI: It's always like this during this time of year.
YUKARI: Anyway, there won't be another full moon until September, right after
summer break ends. ...It's like planning for exams, huh? Well, at least
there are only four Shadows left... We have to hang in there.

JUNPEI: Ugh...

[Junpei is at Port Island Station.]
JUNPEI: Man, it's scorching hot out here.
[He checks his phone.]
JUNPEI: Shoot, it's already the 20th. Summer break's almost over... Too bad
there's nothin' to do.  This place is so boring.
[He looks over and sees the girl from Strega drawing in a sketchbook. Not
knowing who she is, he walks over to her.]
GIRL IN A WHITE DRESS: Get out of my way. I can't see... Move.
[He steps to one side.]
JUNPEI: Uh... Sorry.
GIRL IN A WHITE DRESS: What do you want?
JUNPEI: Uh, nothing. ...My bad.

AIGIS: ...Greetings. The next full moon will appear on the 5th of September. We
will have two weeks to prepare for the Shadow.
JUNPEU: Hey, Ai-chan... you wanna go get some ice cream?
AIGIS: That will not help us prepare. Moreover, ice cream rots away human
teeth... Does it not?
JUNPEI: ...Nah, ice cream's one of the four basic food groups.

=== EVENING ===

YUKARI: ...Oh, hey. Only 10 days left of summer break... You look really bored,
Junpei...
JUNPEI: What's wrong with that? It takes a lot of maturity to fully appreciate
boredom.
YUKARI: Yeah, you're REAL mature...
JUNPEI: Look who's talkin', Yuka-tan! You're the one who's afraid of ghosts...
YUKARI: Sh-Shut up, Stupei!

SHINRIRO: Dammit, I'm tired of your nagging.
AKIHIKO: I'm sorry, but I won't take no for an answer.
[Ken moves to the ledge and sees Shinjiro and Akihiko on the floor below him.]
SHINJIRO: Well, the answer's still the same: I'm not coming back.
AKIHIKO: You know, another new Persona-user joined us... and he's not human.
SHINJIRO: ...What?
AKIHIKO: It's a dog. He lost his master six months ago because of the Shadows.
He's incredibly loyal... Up 'til now, he's been guarding the spot
where his master was killed... despite the bad memories.
SHINJIRO: ......
AKIHIKO: We saw someone die right before our eyes, too... But, it's been two
years since then...
SHINJIRO: ......
AKIHIKO: How long do you plan to beat yourself up over it? You're always at
that spot behind the station, even though you don't hang out with the
crowd there.
SHINJIRO: It doesn't matter. It was my fault, and it can't be erased. What
difference does it make if I come to terms with it? It won't change
anything. This isn't the same as what happened to Miki.
AKIHIKO: Shinji...
SHINJIRO: That's enough, already. I just want to forget it ever happened.
[Shinjiro walks away. The camera pans back up to Ken.]
KEN: Two years ago... ...... It can't be... ...... So his name is Shinji,
huh...?

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Good, you're all here. Please come in.

KEN: Sorry to interrupt.
AKIHIKO: You must be kidding...
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: After running several tests, we've learned that he has more
then adequate potential. I called this meeting so that I could
introduce him, since he'll be joining our squad.
MITSURU: B-But Mr. Chairman, he's still in elementary school. Besides...
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Besides... what? His ability is quite promising. With the
proper training, he could be a big help.
AKIHIKO: But, is HE okay with it?
KEN: Actually, I asked to join. I believe I can be of some assistance... Now,
I finally know why I was given this power.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: ...So, as you can see, it was his own decision.
KEN: Nice to meet you all. I'll try not to get in anyone's way.
AIGIS: Nice to meet you, too.
AKIHIKO: ......

year, I'll be a senior... Huh? That girl...
[He spots the girl from Strega, and walks over to her.]
GIRL IN A WHITE DRESS: ...You again?
JUNPEI: Uh, w-well... I mean, I'm surprised you remember me.
GIRL IN A WHITE DRESS: Same here...
JUNPEI: Well, you kinda stand out in that dress...
[She ignores him and continues drawing.]
JUNPEI: So... What are you drawing?
GIRL IN A WHITE DRESS: Nothing. Why?
JUNPEI: Uhh, no reason... I was just thinking, it must be nice to have
something you're really into.
GIRL IN A WHITE DRESS: It's no big deal... I only draw because I like to.
JUNPEI: Oh, yeah?
[He starts to walk away.]
JUNPEI: ...Still, I'd like to see it when you're done, okay?
[Junpei leaves.]
GIRL IN A WHITE DRESS: ......

=== EVENING ===

AIGIS: ...Greetings. One week remains until the next full moon will appear. As
expected, The Lost are increasing in number.

=== DARK HOUR ===

PHAROS: Hello.
[Main and Pharos are in Main's room.]
PHAROS: I thought I'd remind you... The next full moon will be in one week. Are
you ready...? Only a few trials remain... So, be careful.
[He disappears and reappears at the foot of the bed.]
PHAROS: I look forward to seeing you again.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main is watching TV in his room when his phone rings.]
CHIHIRO: Hello? This is Chihiro... I was wondering... Would you like to go to
the movies with me today? They're having a tear-jerker marathon... I
just love movies like that... So, will you come with me?
CHIHIRO: Y-You will? That's wonderful. Thank you! I can't wait!
Chihiro.
CHIHIRO: Oh... I-I understand... Goodbye.

=== DAYTIME ===

movie marathon. There's a new theme every day. Today, they're showing tear-
jerkers.
CHIHIRO: I know I'm going to cry, so I brought a handkerchief with me. Are you
ready? Let's go get seated.
[The sceen fades out.]
[The screen fades back in; Main and Kazushi exit the theather.]
increased.
CHIHIRO: Those movies were all so sad... I was crying the whole time... Thanks
for coming with me. We should probably get going, though.

=== EVENING ===

KEN: ...Hello! Have you noticed? Those people--"The Lost"... They've been
increasing... I wish there was something I could do.

=== EARLY MORNING ===


=== DAYTIME ===

[Junpei meets the girl at Port Island Station again.]
JUNPEI: So, we meet again, huh?
GIRL IN A WHITE DRESS: That's because you keep coming back.
JUNPEI: I'm Junpei. What's your name? You live around here?
[She ignores him and finishes drawing. After closing her sketchbook, she gets
up to leave.]
JUNPEI: Hey, wait! Your hand...
[She begins to walk away.]
JUNPEI: I said, "Wait"! You're hurt!
GIRL IN A WHITE DRESS: What is it with you!? Why don't you mind your own
business!?
JUNPEI: But, you're bleeding, for cryin' out loud!
[He grabs her hand.]
JUNPEI: C'mon, show me your hand. You need to put some pressure on it.
GIRL IN A WHITE DRESS: Why are you in such a panic?
JUNPEI: Are you crazy? Anyone would freak out over this. You need to see a
doctor. ...You want me to go with you?
GIRL IN A WHITE DRESS: ...... ...You're weird.
[She starts to leave again, but stops.]
GIRL IN A WHITE DRESS: Chidori.
JUNPEI: Huh?
CHIDORI: That's my name. You asked, right, Junpei? ...I'm almost done with the
picture. I doubt you'll understand it, but if you want to see it, then
you know where to find me.
[She leaves.]

=== EVENING ===

MITSURU: Welcome back. Soon, the moon will be full again... I think this goes
without saying, but please make sure you're prepared.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls is talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Good morning... Summer vacation is over...
LISTENING STUDENT: Yeah... I'm in no mood to be here. I just want to turn
around and head back to bed...
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Heh, you might come down with that Apathy Syndrome... Then
you wouldn't have to worry about anything.
LISTENING STUDENT: Noooo! Are you kidding me!? Although, come to think of it,
it doesn't sound too bad. Maybe I'll try it.
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Hahah! Are you serious?
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Takenozuka is teaching Physics.]
MR. TAKENOZUKA: Quiet down! Summer vacation's over! You're back in school now,
so act accordingly! All right, let's start with a question...
Main!
[Main stands up.]
MR. TAKENOZUKA: What happens when the coefficient of friction is zero?
MAIN: 
MR. TAKENOZUKA: Exactly. Been studying, I see. If you apply that to
your summer vacation... It's gone down the hill with a
coefficient of zero. Hey, that sounded pretty cool.
Want me to write it on the board?
MR. TAKENOZUKA: ...Is your head still on vacation? Zero friction means
you slide around, and won't be able to get back to your
feet. If you apply that to your summer vacation... It's
gone down the hill with a coefficient of zero. Hey,
that sounded pretty cool. Want me to write it on the
board?

=== EVENING ===

[Yukari, Junpei, Ken, and Koromaru are in the lounge. Main arrives.]
YUKARI: ...Oh, you're back. Perfect timing. Hey, Fuuka, is Aigis ready?
[Fuuka and Aigis enter; Aigis is wearing a Gekkoukan student's uniform.]
JUNPEI: Ready for what?
YUKARI: She said she wanted to go to school, so I said something to Mitsuru-
senpai as a joke... But, the Chairman overheard and thought it was a
good idea. So as of tomorrow, she'll be a junior.
JUNPEI: Seriously!? He's down with that?
FUUKA: Her said something about studying her behavior in a social
environment...
JUNPEI: Well, as far as I'm concerned, it's a great idea... Just look at how
cute she is in that uniform!
AIGIS: The camouflage Fuuka-san has provided me with seems to be the
appropriate size.
KEN: It looks very natural on you; no one will suspect a thing. But, why does
he want you to go to school? It's not like there's anything special about
it.
AIGIS: With the commencement of the second semester, I intend to synchronize my
schedule with the other members'. If I were to remain here on standby,
it could delay our deployment. Therefore, I request to accompany our
squad leader.
YUKARI: Delay our deployment? Won't you going to school create more problems?
AIGIS: I will make any necessary adjustments as problems arise.
KOROMARU: Woof, woof!
AIGIS: He said, "I want to go to school, too."
YUKARI: Sorry, Koro-chan... You have to stay here.
KOROMARU: 

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Aigis there.]
AIGIS: I see. This must be Tartarus during the daytime.
MAIN: 
AIGIS: Currently, I detect no Shadows in the vicinity. However, we must
remain cautious at all times.
AIGIS: I see. I shall record that in my memory bank.

=== MORNING ===

[Main's homeroom is in session. Aigis is standing up front.]
MS. TORIUMI: Class, we have a new student who will be joining us. She just
transferred here. ...Please introduce yourself.
AIGIS: My name is Aigis. I am pleased to meet you all.
MS. TORIUMI: Aigis... What a strange name... I wonder if she was born overseas.
Let's see... Anything else I should know...?
Hm? ...Humanoid tactical weapon? What on Earth...? ...Clearly,
that's a mistake. It just goes to show, you can't believe
everything you read. You can sit... right over there, in that
empty seat.
JUNPEI: Um, Ms. Toriumi, that spot's already taken. He's just playin' hookey.
MS. TORIUMI: ...Which means he's not here. So, it's free to be used, right?
[Aigis nods and takes her seat next to Main.]
AIGIS: This spot will be perfect... Because I wish to always be by his side.
[Yukari stands up.]
YUKARI: Aigis!
AIGIS: Is there a problem?
CLASSMATE: ...Um, Yukari, why're you standing up?
MS. TORIUMI: My, aren't we just full of drama today? Do me a favor and save the
antics for after school.

=== LUNCHTIME ===

[Main, Junpei, Yukari, and Aigis are talking in their homeroom. Main's phone
rings.]
TEXT MESSAGE: 
want you to come. I'll be waiting by the gate. Meet me there."

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

asking you meet him after school. You should head to the designated meeting
place.
[Main goes to the gate where Akihiko is waiting.]
AKIHIKO: ...There you are. There's something I have to do, and I want you to
come with me.
MAIN: 
[Main nods.]
AKIHIKO: We're going to get someone. ...An old member.
AKIHIKO: Well, this is more important.
[Main goes with Akihiko to the ramen shop at Iwatodai. Shinjiro exits the ramen
shop and notices them.]
SHINJIRO: You're getting on my nerves!
AKIHIKO: The situation has changed. Sorry, but this time, I'm not asking.
SHINJIRO: What?
[Akihiko holds up the briefcase he's been carrying.]
AKIHIKO: This belongs to you. We have a new enemy. They're Persona-users, like
us.
SHINJIRO: Yeah, so what?
[He starts to walk away.]
AKIHIKO: There's more. Ken Amada has joined our team.
SHINJIRO: What the hell are you talking about!?
AKIHIKO: He has the potential, and Ikutsuki-san has okayed it. He's now a
Persona-user.
SHINJIRO: You've gotta be kidding me. ...... Let me ask you one thing... Was it
his decision to join SEES?
AKIHIKO: Yeah. He volunteered.
SHINJIRO: ...I see. ...... Then, count me in.  So, you're the one
leading the operations now, huh? If you don't mind me asking, what
exactly are you fighting for?
MAIN: 
SHINJIRO: Is that so? Well, you do your thing; I'll do mine.
[Shinjiro walks back to Akihiko and takes the briefcase.]
SHINJIRO: Is my room still vacant?
[Akihiko nods and they all walk off.]

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Mitsuru there.]
MITSURU: Good morning. ...You may have already heard this on the news, but...
The number of incidents have increased compared to those during the
last full moon...
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Something must be done... I don't know the reason for the
increase. We'll just have to remain alert at all times...
MITSURU: I do not know... We will just have to remain alert at all
times...

=== EVENING ===

SHINJIRO: ...Hey. ...I haven't introduced myself, have I? I'm Shinjiro Aragaki.
Don't worry... I got your back.
FUUKA: Um... There will be a full moon the day after tomorrow. I'm sure another
Shadow will appear, so... please be ready.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Junpei there.]
JUNPEI: S'up, dude!? There's a full moon tomorrow! ...You remember? But, this
time will be tougher than the last...
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: So? Dude, how can you be so calm?
JUNPEI: There's only 4 Shadows left... Maybe they're gettin' nervous. ...Or,
maybe the next one is just insanely strong! Oops. Haha, I shouldn't
jinx it. Well, we can handle it!

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Junpei meets Chidori at Port Island Station again.]
JUNPEI: Yo, Chidori. How's your hand?
[She shows it to him.]
JUNPEI: Huh? I don't see anything... not even a scar... Did it heal that
quickly?
CHIDORI: Hey, Junpei... What do you do to make yourself feel alive?
JUNPEI: Uh, I dunno... Breathing, I guess?  Y'know, I never really
thought about it before. How 'bout you, Chidori? Is that why you draw?
CHIDORI: Maybe... But, most of these are just scribbles... I don't understand
myself very well.
JUNPEI: I see. Mind if I sit here?
[He takes a seat.]
JUNPEI: To tell ya the truth, there is one thing that makes me feel alive...
When I get to play hero.
[Chidori looks confused.]
JUNPEI: In the darkest hour, unknown to all but a few, the chosen ones stand
against the forces of evil! Our hero, Junpei, fights to protect the
world from these terrifying monsters!
[He stands back up.]
JUNPEI: Heheh... Well, you get the idea. That's when I feel most alive!
CHIDORI: ......
JUNPEI: Umm... You're s'posed to laugh.
CHIDORI: So... Do you fight all alone...?
JUNPEI: H-Hey, I was just kiddin' around...
CHIDORI: You fight during a time that no one knows about, right? So then, no
one knows what you've been doing, either. That means you'll never
receive any recognition... I'm impressed. I didn't know you're that
kind of guy.
JUNPEI: ...For real? You actually believe me?
CHIDORI: Tell me more...
JUNPEI: You really wanna know? Okay, but don't tell anyone, alright? Ya see,
there's this special power called "Persona," and only those who have it
can defeat the monsters. That's what I meant by "the chosen ones." My
friends are fighting too... And ever since I joined 'em, we've been
kicking some serious ass!
CHIDORI: Sounds like fun. Are you the leader? Because it sounds like you're
pretty strong.
JUNPEI: Y-Yeah... I-I guess you could say that. I mean, without me, things
would just fall apart. Someone's gotta be in charge, after all. It's
pretty tough being a leader.
CHIDORI: ......
[Chidori closes her sketch book and gets up to leave.]
CHIDORI: Thank you, Junpei... I had fun today.
JUNPEI: Y-You did?
CHIDORI: It's time for me to go. I'll see you tomorrow, right?
[She leaves.]
JUNPEI: Heheh... Tomorrow, huh? ...All right!!

=== EVENING ===

AKIHIKO: ...Where have you been? Tomorrow is finally the day. I'll make sure we
win, no matter what...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Fuuka there.]
FUUKA: Good morning! ...There's a full moon tonight.
MAIN: 
FUUKA: That's nice to hear... I was getting worried because it's so
soon after summer vacation.
FUUKA: No...! Don't let your guard down because summer vacation was
too long, okay!?
[Main and Fuuka enter the school.]

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

return to the dorm and prepare yourself.

=== EVENING ===

[Junpei arrives outside the dorm.]
JUNPEI: Man, she wasn't at the station today... Maybe I should check again...
Nah, on second thought, I better stay put... The operation's tonight.
Now that I think about it... we're fighting to protect her too. Dude,
that so rocks... Maybe we really are, like, heroes... Yeeaahh!!
[He moves toward the door.]
FEMALE VOICE: Don't move!
[Junpei stops and looks around.]
JUNPEI: Huh?

=== DARK HOUR ===

[Everyone except Junpei and Ken is in the meeting room. Fuuka has Lucia
summoned.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Tonight marks the 6th full moon... Do you detect a Shadow?
FUUKA: Yes... It's near Paulownia Mall... I think.
MITSURU: You think...?
FUUKA: For some reason, I can't quite pinpoint its
location... But, I'm trying to narrow it down...
AKIHIKO: Is that its power?
FUUKA: I don't know.
SHINJIRO: We have enough to go on...
[Ken runs in.]
MITSURU: Did you find Iori?
KEN: I can't find him anywhere. His backpack isn't here, so I don't think he's
been home yet.
YUKARI: That idiot... He knows tonight's the night!
FUUKA: I don't sense him anywhere nearby... Should I take
more time to look for him, just in case?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: No, it's okay. You're all young; sometimes you just get in one
of those moods. Anyway, we should focus on the task at hand.
SHINJIRO: ......
MITSURU: We can't afford to waste any more time. Let's go.
[Lucia disappears and everyone starts to leave. Shinjiro stops Main on his way
out.]
SHINJIRO: Wait... Did he say anything earlier?
MAIN: 
SHINJIRO: Alright.
SHINJIRO: Yeah, maybe...
SHINJIRO: Whatever...
[They walk out. Later, everyone is at Paulownia Mall. Fuuka summons Lucia
again.]
MITSURU: Detect anything?
FUUKA: Only a faint presence. It seems so close, but...
why...!?
MITSURU: Alright, let's split up and search for it. There's no time to lose;
hurry!
[Some of them start to walk off.]
FUUKA: Wait! Please, give me a moment! This is my
responsibility...!
FUUKA: Tell me, Lucia... What is this thing that deceives
me...? Hear the wind's answer in your ear... Touch the earth's answer
with your fingertips... Taste the water's answer on your lips...
AKIHIKO: Hey, is she okay...?
MITSURU: Don't break her concentration.
FUUKA: ...Right beneath our feet... Some kind of...
webbing...?
AIGIS: Perhaps it has something to do with the old power cables underground.
They were just left there when the island's construction was completed.
MITSURU: Power cables...?
AIGIS: Yes, they run underground in many directions, like a web.
AKIHIKO: And they're interfering with her ability?
FUUKA: ...Thank you, Aigis. I understand now. Intereference
isn't the problem... The cables themselves have been possessed by the
Shadow!
YUKARI: They what...!? So... it's underneath this whole area!?
AKIHIKO: ...Now it all makes sense.
KEN: H-How are we supposed to beat something like that!?
SHINJIRO: Tch...
[The scene changes to the dorm roof. The door opens and Junpei is tossed out.
His arms are tied behind him.]
JUNPEI: Ugh...
FAMILIAR VOICE: I can't believe how easy it was to sneak up on you. Are the
others here just as oblivious?
JUNPEI: Dammit... I can't use my power...
[He manages to get to his knees and faces the door.]
JUNPEI: This isn't funny... Chidori.
[Chidori walks out of the door.]
CHIDORI: I want you to do something for me. I have new orders for you to give
to your friends... Surely you have the capacity to communicate with
them.
JUNPEI: Me? Give orders?
CHIDORI: If you do as I say... you won't be harmed. ...All you have to do is
call off the mission. Easy, right? And not just the one tonight...
All of them.
JUNPEI: You want me to cancel the mission? You're not one of "them," are you?
CHIDORI: Quit wasting time.
JUNPEI: ......
[The scene changes back to the mall.]
MITSURU: This is a problem... We have no means of attacking it.
FUUKA: In your notes from previous battles, it said there was
a Shadow that took control of the monorail. Just like that one, this
Shadow must have its own body. Let me see if I can find it...
AKIHIKO: Even if we know where it is, we might not be able to get to it...
AIGIS: There may still be a way to reach the structure the buried cables feed
into...
SHINJIRO: We'll see...
YUKARI: Fuuka...
FUUKA: ...I found it. It's close by... in this
mall!
YUKARI: In here!?
FUUKA: It's inside a small chamber underground. ...It's
rectangular, so I assume it's man-made.
KEN: Is it some sort of room...?
SHINJIRO: Wait a minute... I overheard the manager of Escapade... He was
saying that the power's been acting up lately...
YUKARI: That's no surprise...
SHINJIRO: He said the control panel is located beneath the club. Maybe we
should take a look...
FUUKA: ...That's it!
MITSURU: Good job, Yamagishi. Alright. Once we're ready, we'll make our move!
[Main picks the party members and enters the club. They find a large Shadow
drawing energy from the cables crossing the floor.]
FUUKA: That's the source! It's connected to all those
cables... so be careful you don't get shocked!
[They begin fighting the Shadow.]
FUUKA: The Shadow has a lot of electricity charged up...
Please be careful!
[The Shadow unleashes a strong attack.]
FUUKA: Apparently, it has to charge up before using that one
attack. Please be careful whenever you see the enemy charging!
[The party manages to defeat the Shadow.]
FUUKA: Congratulations. I no longer sense its presence.
[They start to leave.]
FUUKA: Oh, and also... I think I've found Junpei. He's back
at the dorm, but something seems strange... The Chairman's there too,
so he should be okay. But, let's hurry back just in case.
[The scene switches back to the dorm rooftop.]
CHIDORI: ...It seems they've completed their mission.
JUNPEI: What!? ...You can tell!?
CHIDORI: Yes... Through Medea's eyes.
JUNPEI: Medea?
CHIDORI: ...My friend.
JUNPEI: Chidori...
CHIDORI: That's not important... Why didn't you call off the mission? Is it
worth your life? Dying is what people fear most... isn't it?
JUNPEI: Well... I've never actually given anyone orders before... They
wouldn't listen to me anyway... Ya see... I'm not really the one in
charge...
CHIDORI: So you were lying earlier? Why...? ...I don't understand.
JUNPEI: Hey... Answer me this: was it all just an act? ...Us meeting, your
wound, the picture... Were you just setting me up? Now that I think
about it, that cut healed pretty quickly... Haha... I see how it is...
CHIDORI: That was...
[The rooftop door bursts open and the party emerges.]
YUKARI: Junpei!?
CHIDORI: Tch. They're back already!?
[Chidori pulls out an Evoker.]
MITSURU: She's a Persona-user!?
[Chidori points the gun to her head.]
CHIDORI: Medea, come...
[Junpei manages to slip out of the rope binding him. He shoves Chidori to the
floor, making her drop the Evoker.]
JUNPEI: Chidori, stop!
CHIDORI: No! Give it back!!
[Ikutsuki and the rest of the group arrive.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Hm!? When did she...!?
[Akihiko picks up the Evoker.]
AKIHIKO: Sorry, but we can't let you use this.
CHIDORI: Medea!!
FUUKA: I... I didn't sense her up until this very moment... This is my only
power and yet...
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: If even Fuuka couldn't sense her, then she must have some sort
of power to conceal her presence... I didn't have the
slightest clue she was here...
[Aigis walks over to Chidori; Junpei lets go of her and Aigis binds her
hands.]
MITSURU: Are you a member of the group that goes by the name Strega? I have a
number of questions for you.
CHIDORI: ...I'm not... afraid... of dying...
JUNPEI: Ch-Chidori...!?
CHIDORI: ...M-Medea... I'm... ......
MITSURU: Clearly, she's emotionally unstable. We'll let her rest, and save
our questions for later.
JUNPEI: Chidori...
[The scene fades out.]
you all has grown... You learned a new tactic! You can now use "Attack
Fallen"! You succeeded in defeating the Shadow this month, too. You expect
that there will be fewer victims for a while. But now, a new adversary has
emerged... You wonder what will happen... ...... You are exhausted, so you
decide to rest.

=== DAYTIME ===

[Chidori is in the hospital, drawing in her sketchbook. Mitsuru and Akihiko
are visiting her.]
MITSURU: I'll ask you once more... Is Chidori your real name? What kind of
organization is Strega? Are there others besides you three?
[Chidori ignores her.]
MITSURU: 
YUKARI: Hey wait, Junpei! You're not supposed to be here, remember!?
[Junpei runs into the room.]
JUNPEI: Chidori...!
[Yukari runs in after him.]
YUKARI: Junpei! Uh... Sorry. He wouldn't stop bugging me about this place...
JUNPEI: How are you feeling? ...Seems like you've calmed down.
MITSURU: She certainly has. In fact, she won't say a word. ...Maybe we should
confiscate her sketchbook, too.
JUNPEI: Hey, come on... What good would that do!? That won't make her talk!
MITSURU: I'm not so sure about that. She was quite upset when we took her
Evoker. Speaking of which... Where did you get that?
CHIDORI: Medea... Give it back to me! I want her back!!
AKIHIKO: Hey, I told you not to bring that up, didn't I!?
MITSURU: Then, what am I supposed to do!?  I'll have someone else try
next time.
AKIHIKO: ...Yukari, call a nurse. We're done for today. I'll inform Ikutsuki-
san of the difficulties we're having.
CHIDORI: Why...? Why did you take it from me...? Medea...
YUKARI: C'mon, Junpei, let's go.
JUNPEI: Chidori... What happened to you...?

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Yukari there.]
YUKARI: Mornin'. It doesn't seem like Chidori is gonna talk, does it? Junpei
is really worried about her... I wonder what happened...
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Yeah, you're right. But still, I'm a little worried.
[Main and Yukari enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

FUUKA: ...Hi, how was your day? ...Our senpai are at the hospital and won't be
back 'til later. From what I hear, that girl Chidori won't say
anything... Maybe we should wait to go to Tartarus until things are
under control...

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Mitsuru, Akihiko, and Fuuka are visiting Chidori in the hospital.]
MITSURU: So, Yamagishi... Do you sense anything?
[Fuuka shakes her head.]
CHIDORI: ......
MITSURU: By refusing to speak, you're only hurting yourself. We aren't keeping
you here because we hate you; we just want to avoid unnecessary
confrontation.
[Junpei runs in.]
JUNPEI: ...How's Chidori?
AKIHIKO: Again? What's your obsession, Junpei?
JUNPEI: Did she say anything?
[Mitsuru shakes her head.]
JUNPEI: Can I just talk to her?
MITSURU: Iori... It seems like you're letting your emotions get the best of
you. Is everything ok?
JUNPEI: Well... Not exactly... I know she attacked me, but... I can't stop
thinking about her!
FUUKA: Junpei-kun...
[Fuuka gets up and Junpei takes her seat next to Chidori.]
JUNPEI: ...You okay? I'm glad they let you keep your sketchbook... You really
do like to draw, huh...?
CHIDORI: ...... It doesn't matter.
FUUKA: She spoke...
CHIDORI: ...No one else but me can understand my pictures...
JUNPEI: Chidori...!?
[He grabs her hand.]
AKIHIKO: Tch... Again!?
JUNPEI: Why are you bleeding!?
AKIHIKO: She does it to herself.  I thought I had removed all the sharp
objects in here.
MITSURU: ...Apparently, we can't leave her unattended for even one moment. But
fortunately, she heals at an astounding rate...
CHIDORI: Let go of me!
[She shakes him off.]
JUNPEI: Then, at the station... you did that to yourself!?
CHIDORI: ...I never asked for your help. You were the one who misunderstood.
JUNPEI: Well, I want you to stop. You can't be doing that... It's not right...
And I won't let you...
MITSURU: The doctor will be here soon. You two should go now.
FUUKA: Alright. Let's go, Junpei-kun.
[Fuuka and Junpei leave.]
MITSURU: ...So, you seem to have found your voice.

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Junpei there.]
JUNPEI: S'up, Main. Sorry I haven't been around... But, you know, I can't just
leave her alone... Don't ask me why...
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Yeah... Thanks, man.
[Main and Junpei enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

SHINJIRO: ...Hey. How long have we been holding that Chidori girl...?
MAIN: 
SHINJIRO: Oh, yeah? ...Never mind, then.
SHINJIRO: ...Oh, yeah?

=== MORNING ===

[Mrs. Terauchi is teaching English.]
MRS. TERAUCHI: Sometimes, common gestures in Japan mean different things in
other countries. Let's go over some of those today. With your
palm facing down, move your fingers together up and down. In
America, you use this gesture to shoo someone away. What does it
mean in Japan? Junpei, you should know this.
JUNPEI: Huh...? Me? H-Hey, Main, what was the question?
MAIN: 
MRS. TERAUCHI: Junpei... Don't tell me you were asleep! You ought to
know it means "come here" in Japan. Anyway, here's
another one...
JUNPEI: ...I won't forget this, Main!
MRS. TERAUCHI: That's right! See? It means the exact opposite over
there. Here's another one...
JUNPEI: Phew... Thanks, Main.
CLASSMATE: Main told Junpei the answer. He's such a nice guy!

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Mitsuru and Akihiko are in the hospital with Chidori. Junpei enters holding
something under his arm.]
JUNPEI: Yo, Chidorita!
CHIDORI: ...Don't call me that.
JUNPEI: C'mon, cheer up... I brought you a new sketchbook. I thought your old
one might be getting full.
CHIDORI: That wasn't necessary, Junpei.
[Junpei sets it next to her.]
JUNPEI: Heheh, you said my name... I was worried I'd never hear that again.
[Shinjiro enters.]
SHINJIRO: ...Any luck?
MITSURU: She finally started talking. But, nothing useful yet.
AKIHIKO: Well, that's a start. So... Why are YOU here?
[Chidori suddenly begins choking and puts her hands to her throat.]
CHIDORI: Ugh...!!
JUNPEI: Chidori!? Wh-What's wrong!?
CHIDORI: Ugh... Agh...
[An image of a Persona flashes above her; it's choking her.]
MITSURU: A Persona!
SHINJIRO: Tch!
[Shinjiro moves over to her and feeds her something. Chidori recovers.]
CHIDORI: 
JUNPEI: Chidori!
SHINJIRO: Relax... It happens. They're not like us. They can't fully control
their Personas. That's why they need to take supressants... to keep
their Personas from killing them...
MITSURU: Supressants...? ...You know about Strega?
SHINJIRO: You'd be surprised what you can learn on the streets. I'll give the
doc the right pills. ...The rest is up to you.
[He walks out.]
AKIHIKO: Shinji, wait! Hey!!
[Akihiko runs out after him.]
CHIDORI: I... I... ...Junpei?
JUNPEI: Th-Thank God...! I thought you might be...
CHIDORI: Why do you look so scared? Death is nothing to be afraid of...
JUNPEI: What are you saying...?
CHIDORI: Dying just means you don't wake up anymore... that's all.
JUNPEI: Wh-What!? You don't really mean that, do you? I-I don't want you to
die, Chidori!
CHIDORI: Junpei...
JUNPEI: Just because you're not afraid doesn't mean no one else is... Did you
ever think about how I might feel!?
[Mitsuru walks off.]
CHIDORI: Haha... You're so weird, Junpei...
JUNPEI: Ha... Look who's talkin'...
[Meanwhile, Akihiko catches up to Shinjiro at Port Island Station.]
AKIHIKO: Hey, wait! Shinji!! What the hell's going on...? Why did you have
those pills!? I've heard about those... They're taken to supress a
Persona when the user can't control it. But, the side-effects...
You're not taking them, are you?
SHINJIRO: ......
AKIHIKO: Answer me!
SHINJIRO: I don't owe you anything.
AKIHIKO: Tch. The same as always...
SHINJIRO: Save it. I've heard it all before. You think I'm wasting my power...
but you're just too thick-headed. I'm tired of your damn preaching.
[Akihiko punches him and the people standing nearby walk away.]
AKIHIKO: Don't you get it? You know the reason... 10 years ago. My sister. The
fire. I wasn't strong enough to save her. They held me back, while
she...
SHINJIRO: ......
AKIHIKO: That's why I try so hard... We promised, remember? To become strong
enough to do what we think is right... So, why the drugs? Why didn't
you come talk to me...?
SHINJIRO: I'm back in the fight now... So let it go.
AKIHIKO: ...... ...And the side effects?
SHINJIRO: ...... There's something I need to take care of. It's something only
I can do.
AKIHIKO: ...Like what?
SHINJIRO: Listen, don't worry about me. Just do what you think is right.
[He walks away.]

=== EVENING ===

[Main has just arrived at the dorm when his phone rings.]
VOICE ON THE PHONE: Hello? This is Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH: I'm calling to inform you of a change in Tartarus... I believe a
path that was blocked is now open... I thought you might like to
know. ...I wish you a safe journey.
MITSURU: Welcome back. ...I will allow Iori to take care of that girl for the
time being. It's not the right time to be bombarding her with
quesitons. Besides, we still have three Shadows to contend with. We
should be able to accomplish that within the next few months, unless
the situation changes. Don't let your guard down until the very end.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Yukari there.]
YUKARI: Mornin'. Hey, Main-kun... I wonder why Shinjiro-senpai came back so
suddenly...
MAIN: 
YUKARI: He's kinda scary, if you ask me... But, it doesn't seem like
he's rejoining SEES just cuz he likes to fight.
YUKARI: Yeah, I guess. He's kinda scary, if you ask me... But, it
doesn't seem like he's rejoining SEES just cuz he likes to
fight.
[Main and Yukari enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Edogawa is teaching Miscellaneous.]
MR. EDOGAWA: Hello, class. Bagahi Laca Bachabe... Are you ready? Then, let's
begin. Today, we'll discuss the magic of the Renaissance. The
Renaissance was a time when the arts and the sciences enjoyed a
resurgence in Europe. Naturally, this had a profound influence on
magic. It might be more accurate to say the two studies helped
improve one another... As to why the Renaissance helped to further
magic... They had found a way to escape the rule of the church. By
studying the teachings of previously forbidden sects, the
knowledge of magic spread greatly. The Renaissance also brought
about the revival of ancient Greek and Roman literature. Magical
texts, such as the Hermetica, received new translations and study.
Philosophy, natural history, alchemy, astrology... The book was
filled with a wide range of subjects, and could be called the
bible of magic. Just as science and astronomy have made strides in
the modern day... So, too, has the art of magic. You can see this
in the emergence of a great magician, who applied the knowledge of
the Renaissance. John Dee was a professor who advised the Queen of
England, but... with the magical knowledge he obtained, he was
able to talk to angels. Then there was Hohenheim, a doctor who
traveled across Europe... He became known as Paracelsus, a
renowned physician and alchemist. Of course, a magician's life
wasn't an easy one. Both men lived lives riddled with persecution.
...Are you all listening? Keep your minds down to Earth!
Eeeheehee. Here's a test to see if you were paying attention. Get
it wrong, and your house will become irrevocably haunted. Bagahi
Laca Bachabe... Now... Who should be my victim? Main, I ask thee.
[Main stands up.]
MR. EDOGAWA: Which book helped further the art of magic during the Renaissance?
MAIN: 
MR. EDOGAWA: Wrong! Now you'll be seeing a woman's face in the
ceiling... Magic at the time had a great influence on the
church-ruled society. Several magicians were involved with
the central part of the Renaissance, the religious
revolution...
MR. EDOGAWA: Correct. Back to your peaceful life. Magic at the time had
a great influence on the church-ruled society. Several
magicians were involved with the central part of the
Renaissance, the religious revolution...

=== EVENING ===


=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Ono is teaching class.]
MR. ONO: The next chapter discusses the problems of the Kamakura shogunate...
Kamakura is cool and all, but it can't beat the Sengoku era! Have we
covered enough of this yet? I can skip over to the Sengoku era, yeah?
All right, let's take a closer look at the Sengoku era, from the
beginning. As you all know, it's generally agreed that the era began
with the Coup of Meiou. In the year 1493...
MAIN: 
MR. ONO: ...Wow, is time up already? I can't believe that went by so
fast! We're only up to 1494, but there's still a lot to
cover... I guess it can't be helped. We'll pick up here next
time.

[Main puts his head down.]

now "Great"!

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Junpei is visiting Chidori at the hospital.]
JUNPEI: No one else is coming today. ...But, they said we can't give you back
your Evoker.
CHIDROI: ...I wasn't expecting them to. That's why they started watching me in
the first place.
JUNPEI: ...Oh, how's that cut doin'? ...Prolly already healed, huh. ...So, how
come you're not drawing today...?
CHIDORI: ...Does it matter?
JUNPEI: Well, uh, not really...
[Junpei notices some flowers on the bedside table.]
JUNPEI: Hey, they're all dried up... I guess it's been pretty hot lately.
[Chidori looks over and extends her hand.]
JUNPEI: It's okay. I'll take care of it...
[There's a flash and the flowers suddenly appear full of life.]
JUNPEI: Whoa... What was that!?
CHIDORI: ...I made them healthy again.
JUNPEI: You can do that!? That's incredible, Chidori!
CHIDORI: It's nothing special. You have powers too, don't you?
JUNPEI: Well, yeah, I guess... but... That's about all I've got going for me.
Without that... I'd be a nobody. I just talk a big game... pretendin'
like I'm some kinda hero. But in reality... I don't know what the hell
I'm fighting for... or why I'm here at all...
CHIDORI: Why... Why we are here...?
JUNPEI: When I was a kid, I had this crazy dream...
CHIDORI: ...What kind of dream?
JUNPEI: That one day, I'd grow up to be a pro baseball player... Pretty stupid,
huh? I guess that's part of bein' a kid.
CHIDORI: Is that so...? I don't remember much from my childhood. All I remember
is... being surrounded by white.
JUNPEI: Huh?
CHIDORI: I hate hospitals...
JUNPEI: Yeah, me too... ...... I'm sorry...
CHIDORI: But, I don't mind that much this time... since you come to see me so
often.
JUNPEI: Chidori... I... I understand. I won't let you down.

=== EVENING ===


=== DARK HOUR ===

PHAROS: Hi... It's been a while.
[Main and Pharos are in Main's room.]
PHAROS: Three seasons have passed since we met... Time goes by so quickly, and
many things change. Yet, some things will always remain the same...
Don't you agree?
MAIN: 
PHAROS: Yes... If you say so, then it must be.
PHAROS: Hmmmm... If you say so, then perhaps I was mistaken.
PHAROS: I understand completely. No matter how hard we try,
there is no way to unravel the future's mysteries...
PHAROS: Talking with you has stirred up certain memories... That tower, for
instance. I've been thinking about it lately... I wonder... Will our
relationship stay the same...? Or, will it evolve...?
[Pharos disappears and reappears at the foot of the bed.]
PHAROS: No matter what the future holds, you and I will be friends. ...That is
for certain.
[Pharos disappears. Death Arcana to rank 6.]

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: What is your class gonna do for the Culture Festival?
LISTENING STUDENT: A haunted house. I bet I'll be stuck playing the ghost.
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Being a ghost isn't so bad. You can just show up and put on
the costume. I have to do a magic show... By the way, did
you hear a typhoon is on its way? I hear it's a big one...
The school will be empty.
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Ms. Miyahara is teaching Math.]
MS. MIYAHARA: Listen carefully, everyone. Some of you think too hard about
simple questions. Now, 4 divided by 2 is 2, right? Okay, so...
Today's the 14th, which means... Main!
[Main stands up.]
MS. MIYAHARA: What's 6 divided by 0?
MAIN: 
MS. MIYAHARA: Well... If you think mathematically, it's an easy
problem. This is an equation that cannot be defined.
It'll take a while to explain why, but you all want to
know, right? First off, the study of mathematics is...
MS. MIYAHARA: Precisely! It's an equation that cannot be defined.
It'll take a while to explain why, but you all want to
know, right? First off, the study of mathematics is...

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Akihiko there.]
AKIHIKO: Hey, Main. Three left, huh? And the next one won't come for another
three weeks. Man, why can't they just come all at once?
MAIN: 
AKIHIKO: Then again, what would we look forward to afterwards?
AKIHIKO: Haha. That's true.
AKIHIKO: But, with more people now, it should be easier to defeat them. I can't
wait for the next full moon.
[Main and Akihiko enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

FUUKA: ...Hi, how was your day? I heard that Chidori-san is starting to open up
a little... However, she's still uncomfortable talking about Personas...
It might take a while before she's ready.
AKIHIKO: Oh well. We still have three Shadows to worry about, so I'll
concentrate on that. They'll be sorry they ever set foot into this
world.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of boys are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Hey, did you hear!? Yukari is going to dress up as a maid
for a cafe in the Culture Festival!
LISTENING STUDENT: Wait, are you serious!? Why? What happened?
GOSSIPING STUDENT: She drew the short straw in the Archery Club! She's gonna be
pissed, but that's all the more reason to check out the
cafe!
[Main and the boys enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

MITSURU: Welcome back. There are over two weeks until the moon is full again,
and already The Lost are increasing in number... We have to stop the
Shadows at any cost.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of boys are talking.]
GOSSPING STUDENT: I heard there's a nasty typhoon on the way. You think we'll
still have the Culture Festival on Saturday?
LISTENING STUDENT: Nah, I don't think so. The way they're talking, the
typhoon's going to be way too destructive.
GOSSIPING STUDENT: That's not good. I hope Japan doesn't become an undersea
country...
[Main and the boys enter the school.]

the dorm.

=== EVENING ===

[Main runs into the dorm and closes the door.]
JUNPEI: You weren't quick enough, huh?
[Main walks over to the couches where everyone else is gathered.]
FUUKA: According to the news, a typhoon just hit. Supposedly, it's the biggest
one on record. It's moving slowly, too, so it'll be around for a
while...
JUNPEI: Yeah, thanks to that, the school festival got canned. ...Well, setting
all that stuff up is a pain, so I don't mind. But, it sucks that we'll
be stuck indoors... So, how are you gonna spend your break?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Seriously? Dude, you're killin' me...
JUNPEI: What about you, Fuuka?
FUUKA: Me? The only thing I plan to do is go to the movies...
JUNPEI: Ooh, a movie? Is it a date...?
FUUKA: It-It's not like that. I'm going with Natsuki-chan. She absolutely loves
movies... But with this typhoon, I don't know if we'll be able to go.
JUNPEI: How 'bout you, Yuka-tan? Will ya still have practice?
YUKARI: ...I doubt it. The archery range is outside, so it's most likely
canceled until the storm blows over.
AKIHIKO: Same here. This stupid typhoon is gonna mess up my training.
JUNPEI: What about you, Senpai?
MITSURU: ...I haven't decided. Besides, what business is it of yours, Iori?
JUNPEI: Me? Well, I'd be happy to tell you about my plans...
AIGIS: I suspect that you will be visiting Chidori-san. Although she has
stabilized, we cannot release her.
JUNPEI: Man, Ai-chan, you must be psychic. And ya know what? She WANTS me to
come! ...Not to brag or anything... I, um... just thought I should
check up on her... Ya know, with the storm and all.
AKIHIKO: ...What's up with him?
FUUKA: Umm... Well... Oh, yeah! Ken-kun. What are you going to do during the
break?
KEN: Oh, nothing in particular...
JUNPEI: Come on, you have to be doing something.
KEN: Well, I'll probably go visit the shrine.
JUNPEI: Dude, you're a kid, not an old man.
KEN: But, that's where I always go. I guess you could say I made a vow...
Anyway, I'm going back to my room. I have a lot of homework to do...
JUNPEI: Oh, okay. Call me if you get stuck.
[Ken leaves.]
AKIHIKO: ......
SHINJIRO: ......

incredibly sleepy... You fall asleep as soon as your head hits the pillow.

=== DARK HOUR ===

[The "entering the Velvet Room" anime replays.]
IGOR: I have been waiting for you. I last summoned you in your dreams quite
some time ago. Several seasons have come and gone since I first offered
my assistance... Now, then... Your special power--Persona... Have you
been using it wisely?
MAIN: 
IGOR: Hmmm... So, you haven't given it much thought?
IGOR: I see... Well, at least your candor is a sign of maturity.
IGOR: To be perfectly honest, I sense a great catastrophe in your future. But,
it would be a pity to lose one such as yourself unnecessarily...
Therefore, please allow me to provide you with a new form of assistance.
Henceforth, you shall be able to fuse four or more Personas. I am certain
that this will be of great benefit to you.
IGOR: But now, you must be tired. Please, rest easy... Until we meet again...
Farewell.

Through the window, the sky looks clear. You feel refreshed. Today is Respect

FUUKA: Good morning! ...It feels like fall since the typhoon passed, doesn't
it?  I hope the fighting ends before winter comes...
MAIN: 
FUUKA: ...I hope so...
FUUKA: ...True.
[Main and Fuuka enter the school.]

=== AFTERNOON ===

[Ms. Ounishi is teaching Chemistry.]
MS. OUNISHI: ...Therefore, love is a motivational system that stimulates the
urge to procreate. One theory states that love between humans
lasts no longer than two years.
MAIN: 
MS. OUNISHI: So, it's not my fault if I get tired of him after two
years! It's only natural! How can he blame me for it!?
It's simple biology!

KEN: ...Hello! ...Are we going to Tartarus today? The Lost are increasing, and
I wanna get stronger... So if you're going, please take me.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Those incidents with the unconscious people... Is it me, or
do they seem to be getting worse?
LISTENING STUDENT: No, it's not just you... They're definitely on the rise.
GOSSPING STUDENT: It's all over the news, too. The whole thing makes me
uncomfortable...
LISTENING STUDENT: What if it started happening all over the world...?
GOSSPING STUDENT: H-Hey, don't say stuff like that...
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? The next full moon's coming up... And since Chidori's
getting better, I think I should start training again. Besides, those
Apathy freaks are popping up everywhere.

=== DARK HOUR ===

PHAROS: Good evening.
[Main and Pharos are in Main's room.]
PHAROS: I'm sure I don't have to tell you this, but... there's only one more
week until the full moon. ...I hope nothing serious happens. But, who
knows what the future will bring... so be careful.
[He disappears and reappears at the foot of the bed.]
PHAROS: Remember, I'm always watching you. ...We'll meet again.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: The latest person to pass out was right around my
neighborhood...
LISTENING STUDENT: There've been a few around my neighborhood, too. I'm
scared...
GOSSIPING STUDENT: They said on TV that it's not contagious, but I feel like
it's a sign of the end of the world...
LISTENING STUDENT: Wh-What...? Don't say that!
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Ms. Miyahara is teaching Math.]
MS. MIYAHARA: Look at the figure 8... Isn't it cute? Almost as charming as the
curly tail on the 9... And the number 2! Not many people
appreciate it, but 2 is awesome! Numbers are so adorable!
MAIN: 
MS. MIYAHARA: On the other hand, things like the square root sign, or
the sigma, have a more mature feel. Put them together
with numbers, and you can express anything in the world.
Heart, mind, emotions... It all boils down to synapses
firing in the brain. Which means they can be expressed by
numbers! Isn't it amazing what those cute numbers can do?

JUNPEI: Let's OWN that next Shadow and make the world a better place, huh!?
[Main and Junpei enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

AKIHIKO: ...Where have you been? Next Sunday is most likely the day... It's
nothing to worry about, though. I'm sure we'll be fine.
JUNPEI: Well, you can count on me!
MITSURU: Wait a minute... Is it just me, or does Iori actually sound serious
for a change?
JUNPEI: Hey, what's that s'posed to mean!?

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: We have to wear winter wear from now on... It's so heavy, my
shoulders hurt. But I looked in the pocket, and I found a
lost possession!
LISTENING STUDENT: My shoulders hurt too... Plus, I hear weird voices... And
I've got a headache...
GOSSIPING STUDENT: ...P-Possession...!

[Mr. Ono is teaching Japanese History.]
MR. ONO: I'll finally get to tell you about Masamune Date today! I couldn't
sleep a wink last night, I was so excited! Let's get started! We'll
begin with Date's early life. In 1567, at Yonezawa Castle...
MAIN: 
MR. ONO: ...And at age 15, Masamune Date emerged victorious on his very
first battle! Thus began his rise to power... Huh? We're out
of time? ...What's your next class? Composition? It's okay,
don't worry about it. I'll talk to Ms. Toriumi when she comes.
Let's continue...

three Shadows left... We're almost done.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Aigis there.]
AIGIS: The Lost seem to be growing in number.
MAIN: 
AIGIS: I cannot explain why, but our highest priority should be eliminating the
remaining Shadows. The moon will be full tomorrow. I shall accompany
you in battle.
[Main and Aigis enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Ms. Toriumi is teaching Composition.]
MS. TORIUMI: I hope you guys haven't forgotten that exams start in 10 days, two
weeks from Tuesday. If this class doesn't do well, it'll be my
fault, so you'd all better study hard! All right, now let's resume
the reading from page 120. "Excuse me, but your fly is down." "I
know. It needed some fresh air."
MAIN: 
MS. TORIUMI: I'm sure I don't need to point out what a superb passage
this is. The quick wit displayed in an awkward
situation... He's using humor to avoid humiliation. It's a
simple conversation, but it reflects the human condition
very accurately.

[Everyone except Ken and Shinjiro is gathered in the meeting room. Fuuka has
Lucia summoned.]
FUUKA: I've located the target... It's in the plaza in front
of Iwatodai Station!
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: This will be the 10th... Only a few left, but let's worry about
them one at a time.
YUKARI: ...Assuming they come one at a time.  Just kidding.
FUUKA: ...Yukari-chan, how did you know!? I sense two of them!
YUKARI: Are you serious!? Me and my big mouth...
[Akihiko looks around.]
AKIHIKO: ...Where's Shinji?
FUUKA: He just notified me that he'll meet up with you later.
I didn't ask any questions.
AKIHIKO: ...Figures. He's always played by his own rules.
JUNPEI: It's okay. At least he's coming, right?
YUKARI: Yeah. Not like someone I know who missed last time.
JUNPEI: Hello? I was tied up, remember!? Sheesh, give a guy a break.
YUKARI: Wait, Ken-kun isn't here, either... Hey Junpei, go get him. That'll be
your punishment for last time.
JUNPEI: Punishment...? What is this, kindergarten?  That little shit is
more trouble than he's worth.
[Junpei walks off.]
MITSURU: All right, let's move out. This time, there are two enemies. We'll
determine our formation once we arrive.
[Everyone nods. Later, the party arrives at Iwatodai Station.]
YUKARI: There they are! This is the way we go to school! We've gotta protect
this place...
FUUKA: It seems like they've been waiting for us.
MITSURU: ...Where's Amada?
JUNPEI: He wasn't in his room, so who knows...
AKIHIKO: Dammit, Shinji... Where are you?
FUUKA: Um, I think we should hurry... They look like they're about to make
their move.
MITSURU: Alright, let's decide on a team and engage the enemy!
[After selecting a team, the party moves to the Shadows.]
FUUKA: I'll keep you informed! Please be careful!
[The Strength Shadow casts a spell and some flower petals surround the Fortune
Shadow.]
FUUKA: I don't detect the Fortune one anymore! The Strength
one must have done something! You can't attack it right now...
Concentrate on the one whose Arcana is Strength!
[The Fortune Shadow drops down a roulette table.]
FUUKA: That wheel's effects depend on where it stops. Red is
bad luck... I hope it doesn't come up.
[The party manages to kill the Strength Shadow.]
FUUKA: Um, I detect Fortune again! So you can attack that one
now!
[The party defeats the Fortune Shadow as well.]
FUUKA: Good job, everyone.
JUNPEI: Man, talk about exhausting.
AIGIS: This time, those two who call themselves Strega did not interfere.
YUKARI: It must be because we have Chidori. Anyway, I'm glad everything went
well. But, what happened to Shinjiro and Ken?
AKIHIKO: ......
FUUKA: The Chairman doesn't seem to be too concerned, so he went home.
MITSURU: Yamagishi, where are those two?
FUUKA: I'm sorry, I haven't been able to locate them yet.
MITSURU: Let's return to the dorm, and then go from there.
AKIHIKO: ......
MITSURU: ...Akihiko, are you listening?
AKIHIKO: Today is... October 4th, huh... Just go back without me. I'm gonna go
look for them for a while.
[Akihiko runs off.]
YUKARI: Senpai...? ...What's wrong?
MITSURU: Akihiko...?
[Meanwhile, Ken is behind Port Island station. He has his spear out. Shinjiro
enters.]
KEN: You came...
SHINJIRO: ......
KEN: I'm surprised you abandoned the operation. ...Do you know why I asked you
to meet me here? Two years ago today... October 4th. That was the day my
mom died here. They called it an accident... but it wasn't. I saw the
whole thing... You murdered her!!
SHINJIRO: ......
KEN: ...Since then, it's been one bad thing after another... And all I get from
people is sympathy, no matter where I go. What's the point in living...?
I even thought about killing myself... but Mom wouldn't have wanted that.
...That's why I decided that I had to find her killer--YOU! You said once
that you wanted to forget what happened on that day... So, when I found
out it was a full moon today, I knew I had to confront you. ...Today, Mom
is watching over me. I'll make you remember what you did to her! I'm gonna
kill you!!
[He readies his spear.]
SHINJIRO: ...... Do it.
[The party returns to the dorm's meeting room.]
YUKARI: Huh? No one's here...
JUNPEI: Anyway, why was Akihiko-san acting so weird? What's so special about
October 4th?
MITSURU: October the 4th...  That's right! I was so caught up in the
operation that I didn't realize it... This is the day Amada's mother
was killed!
JUNPEI: You serious!?
MITSURU: Yamagishi, I need you to find the two of them immediately. There's a
good chance that they're together. Akihiko must have already realized
that...
FUUKA: I-I understand.
[Fuuka summons Lucia.]
YUKARI: Umm... What's going on?
MITSURU: Although her death was officially listed as an accident... we're the
ones who killed Amada's mother. It was two years ago, when we were
pursuing an unusual Shadow that had escaped into the city... We were
in a residential area, but the Shadow was all we were thinking
about... Aragaki was still new, and he momentarily lost control of his
power... Unfortunately, there was a casualty: Amada's mother.
JUNPEI: No way... Are you shittin' me!?
YUKARI: Then, to Ken-kun, Senpai is...
MITSURU: Amada volunteered to join us. But, now that I think about it...
FUUKA: I found them! They're together, and another Persona-
user is nearby...
MITSURU: Akihiko?
FUUKA: No... it's... It's a member of Strega!
JUNPEI: That's not good.
MITSURU: Ugh... It's an absolute nightmare!
[She runs out.]
YUKARI: Senpai!! C'mon!!
[The party goes after her. The scene switches back to Ken and Shinjiro.]
SHINJIRO: ...Do it. I won't stop you. You're right... I wanted to forget.
That's why I left the group, and tried to suppress my power... But,
nothing I did could erase the memory... And now, I find myself here--
the last place I want to be.
KEN: ......
SHINJIRO: It's my fault... This is what I deserve. But... let me give you one
warning.
KEN: Warning...?
SHINJIRO: If you decide to take my life, you'll end up like me. Just remember
that...
KEN: Is that supposed to change my mind...?
SHINJIRO: Even if all you have now is hatred, one day you'll regret it.
KEN: Shut up! That's a load of crap!!
TAKAYA: ...He is correct.
[Takaya enters from the other direction.]
TAKAYA: There is no reason for him to feel regret... That is the nature of
revenge. Is it not permissible to kill those who are themselves
killers?
SHINJIRO: ...You.
TAKAYA: The loss of Chidori has posed a bit of a challenge for us... But, we
cannot simply ignore your meddling.
[He pulls out his revolver.]
TAKAYA: Do not fear. This life is but a stepping stone. Salvation shall be
yours...
[Shinjiro moves forward.]
SHINJIRO: What!?
TAKAYA: You cannot defy fate... You shall die... whether or not it is at the
hand of this boy.
SHINJIRO: ......
TAKAYA: You've been taking those pills for some time now... You don't have
much longer.
KEN: What's he talking about!?
SHINJIRO: That's bullshit!
TAKAYA: Listen to your body... You know it to be true.
KEN: What does he mean...? You're going to die...? ...No matter what I do?
That's not fair!! All this time! I've been waiting for this!!
TAKAYA: The cause of death is not of importance. Besides, the breath of life
is faint in you as well, child. ...After killing him, you were planning
to join him, were you not?
KEN: ......
TAKAYA: Since you are both destined to perish, allow me to do the honors... A
slight change in timing shouldn't matter too much.
SHINJIRO: Go to hell!
[Shinjiro rushes at him; Takaya shoots him in the chest.]
SHINJIRO: Ugh...! Agh...!
KEN: N-No...
[Takaya aims his revolver at Shinjiro's head.]
TAKAYA: Now then... With what life you have left, answer me this... There is
one like Chidori among you, is there not? This has enabled you to
locate and defeat those we wish to protect. Now tell me... Which one of
you is it?
SHINJIRO: Ugh... ah...
KEN: ......
TAKAYA: ...What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?
SHINJIRO: Th-There's... no one...
KEN: Wait! It-It's me!
TAKAYA: Is that true?
KEN: ...Yes. That's the only reason they let me join.
SHINJIRO: Ken... no...!
[Takaya kicks him over.]
SHINJIRO: Agh!!
TAKAYA: ...Quiet. You had your chance.
KEN: It doesn't matter anymore... I'll never have my revenge. ...I have no
reason to live...
TAKAYA: ...I see. So, you have achieved resolution.
[He points his revolver at Ken.]
TAKAYA: How enviable... Then, you shall be first. Rest peacefully...
[Takaya fires his revolver at Ken. Shinjiro manages to get up in time and block
the shot with his body.]
TAKAYA: What is the meaning of this? Why would you risk your life to save this
child?
[Shinjiro turns to look at him as the rest of the party arrives.]
AKIHIKO: Shinji!
TAKAYA: How very disappointing...
[He runs off as the party gathers around Shinjiro.]
SHINJIRO: What's with the long face... Isn't this what you wanted?
FUUKA: No! Senpai!
[Fuuka tries to help Shinjiro but he shrugs her off.]
SHINJIRO: It's alright... Give yourself time, make your anger your
strength... Come on, Ken, you're just a kid. You've got your whole
life ahead of you, so don't waste it. Make it your own, okay?
KEN: But... I... I...
SHINJIRO: Aki... Take care of him...
AKIHIKO: I will...
[Shinjiro manages to get to his feet.]
SHINJIRO: This is how it should be...
[He takes a few steps away before collapsing onto the ground. Ken drops to his
knees and pounds the ground as he cries.]
KEN: Noooo!!
[The scene fades out.]
The loss of your comrade was certainly unexpected. That night, no one spoke
a word. And, the next day...

=== EARLY MORNING ===


=== MORNING ===

[The student body is gathered in the auditorium. A memorial service is being
held for Shinjiro.]
PRINCIPAL: No words can express the sense of loss we feel as a result of this
terrible tragedy. He had a lifetime of opportunity ahead of him...
As educators, we are to blame for ignoring his silent calls for
help. We lost him to violence before we had a chance to help him
realize his true potential... Forgive us... Forgive us for our
negligence...
[Main, Yukari, and Junpei are shown in the seats.]
YUKARI: ......
JUNPEI: .....
SENIOR IN FRONT: Will this speech ever end...? I don't even know who this
Aragaki guy was...
SENIOR TO THE SIDE: I heard he never came to school. ...Prolly just some punk.
Anyway, I gotta get home... I have to study for my mock-
exam.
SENIOR IN FRONT: Hey, you guys know who Aragaki is? Wait, you're not seniors,
so how would you know? Anyway, can you believe this? Scary,
huh?
MAIN: 
SENIOR IN FRONT: Yeah, seems like he was a no-name. Man, when is this
gonna end? I don't have time for this.
SENIOR IN FRONT: ...Huh? ...Dang, I was just asking...
SENIOR IN FRONT: Damn... What's your problem?
[Junpei stands up.]
JUNPEI: Shut up... ......
SENIOR IN FRONT: Huh? ...What're you doing?
JUNPEI: I said shut up!!
MS. TORIUMI: Iori, sit down!  I'll never hear the end of this...
JUNPEI: Tch...
[He sits back down.]
YUKARI: Just ignore them, Junpei...  Hey... Have you seen Akihiko-
senpai today?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: ...Besides at the dorm.
YUKARI: He was absent this morning... I wonder if he'll show up at all. I hope
he's okay...

=== LUNCHTIME ===

[Main, Yukari, and Junpei are in their homeroom. Mitsuru enters and walks over
to them.]
MITSURU: Can I talk to you for a moment? When you get back today, please meet
me in the lounge. You know what it's regarding.
YUKARI: Yeah...
MITSURU: I don't expect you to have collected your thoughts. In fact, I am
still at a loss myself... I'll see you then.
[She leaves.]
JUNPEI: It's about Ken, huh...  This'll be a fun meeting...

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Akihiko enters the auditorium and climbs the stage. He addresses the picture
of Shinjiro.]
AKIHIKO: Yo. I had the usual for lunch... Ramen tastes a lot better when you're
cutting class. ...Make sure you invite me next time.
[He turns his back.]
AKIHIKO: Say something, will ya...? Why are you always like that? You're so
stubborn. Put yourself in my shoes for a change...
[He turns back around and leans on the table.]
AKIHIKO: ...You think it's the other way around, huh? I guess you're right...
I was too obsessed with power... Ever since I lost Miki, that's all
I've cared about... I thought that if I was strong enough, I could
protect anyone... But, I was wrong... And now, you're gone too...
I'm such an idiot.
[He hangs his head and pounds the table a few times in frustration.]
AKIHIKO: In battle, there's always a chance of dying... I knew that! But...
I was so focused on fighting that I didn't notice anything else! It
didn't matter how tough I was! Look what happened!
[He drops down to his knees.]
AKIHIKO: Ahhhhhhhhh...
[He looks back up at the picture.]
AKIHIKO: ...Yeah, I know... Crying won't change anything, will it...?
[He stands back up.]
AKIHIKO: Alright, Shinji... You watch from there with Miki. I still have things
to do, right?
[Polydeuces appears above Akihiko, and then changes into another Persona.]
[Caesar disappears.]
AKIHIKO: I know that much. I can't carry this guilt forever... I'm getting
tired of it.

=== EVENING ===

[Main arrives at the dorm and sits down; everyone else is already in the
lounge.]
MITSURU: You all know the reason we're gathered here. We need to discuss how to
deal with Amada... I've already consulted the Chairman. Aigis, bring
Amada here.
AIGIS: Understood.
[Aigis leaves.]
FUUKA: It's my fault... When Shinjiro-senpai told me he'd be late, I thought it
was strange, but I said nothing. If only I'd listened to my intuition...
YUKARI: Don't be so hard on yourself, Fuuka.
MITSURU: It's not your fault. If anyone should have realized it, it should have
been me.
JUNPEI: I knew this wasn't a game... But, I never thought it'd end up like
this...
AKIHIKO: There's no point dwelling on the past. Shinji's last words were
"This is how it should be." He was a hell of a guy... He even faced
death head on. ...That's why, from this day forward, I'll face things
head on, too.
JUNPEI: That's cool, man...
YUKARI: Senpai...
MITSURU: ......
[Aigis runs back in.]
AIGIS: Allow me to report! Amada-san is not in his room!
YUKARI: He's not!?
AIGIS: There are indications that the window has been pried open.
FUUKA: Ken-kun...!
[Fuuka starts for the door.]
YUKARI: Wait, Fuuka! Do you know where he is?
FUUKA: Well... no... but we can't just let him go off on his own, right!?
YUKARI: So, where do you plan on looking?
FUUKA: I don't know, but we have to find him! He must feel so alone...
YUKARI: Fuuka...
FUUKA: You of all people should understand!
[She pauses.]
FUUKA: I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
AKIHIKO: Let Ken do what he wants. Bringing him back won't change anything...
and we can't keep treating him like a kid.
MITSURU: Akihiko...
AKIHIKO: It's his choice. He's the only one who can decide how he's going to
live his life. ...The same goes for all of us.

=== EVENING ===

[Main has just arrived at the dorm when his phone rings.]
VOICE ON THE PHONE: Hello? This is Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH: I'm calling to inform you of a change in Tartarus... I believe a
path that was blocked is now open... I thought you might like to
know. ...I wish you a safe journey.
[The scene changes to Ken, who is at the spot behind Port Island Station.]
KEN: ......
[Akihiko walks in.]
AKIHIKO: You look half dead. What are you doing here?
KEN: When Mom died protecting me, no one would believe the real reason for her
death... To this day, it's still on file as an unexplained accident.
That's why I wanted to make it clear... I thought that's what she would
have wanted... Maybe then she'd finally be at peace... They said he died
by some violent crime, right? No one knows the truth. ...Just like with
Mom. And once again, I'll be left behind...
AKIHIKO: The dead are never coming back. You have to accept that. ...You're on
your own now.
KEN: ......
AKIHIKO: I'm not here to drag you back... You can stay in this place until you
die, if that's what you want. ...But, if you still have the will to
fight, then come back and stand on your own two feet.
[Akihiko walks away.]
KEN: He's right...
[Ken turns around and hits the wall.]
KEN: I've known it all along; I've just been lying to myself... I was consumed
by hatred... I couldn't face the thought of being alone... But... that's
exactly what happened...
[He hits the wall a couple more times.]
KEN: All this time, I've just been running away... ...... I've made up my
mind... Shinjiro-san... I'll see it through to the end.
[Nemesis appears above Ken, and changes into another Persona.]
[Kala-Nemi disappears.]
KEN: I'll be okay now, Mom... Goodbye...
[The scene shifts to the dorm lounge, where everyone else is gathered.]
YUKARI: It's already been a day...
MITSURU: ...Yes, it has.
JUNPEI: So, where's Akihiko-san?
FUUKA: He said to leave Ken-kun alone, but I don't know... Maybe we should look
for him...
MITSURU: What's your opinion?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: You think so, too...? He IS still a kid...
MITSURU: So, you agree with Akihiko then...
FUUKA: ...I can't wait any longer! I'm going right now to--
KOROMARU: Woof, woof!
[Koromaru runs over to the door; Ken enters.]
YUKARI: Ken-kun!?
[Yukari and Fuuka run over to Ken.]
KEN: ......
FUUKA: Thank goodness... I was so worried...
KEN: You were?
[Everyone else moves over to Ken.]
MITSURU: Amada... Are you able to fight?
KEN: Yes. ...I won't run off again.
JUNPEI: You sure?
KEN: I'm positive.
FUUKA: It's alright... We can trust him...
YUKARI: ...Geez, don't make us worry like that, okay?
MITSURU: ...Alright. I'll talk to the Chairman. ...Get some rest.

=== DARK HOUR ===

PHAROS: Hello.
[Main and Pharos are in Main's room.]
PHAROS: ...It's cold tonight. Can you believe it's already autumn? It'll be
winter before you know it. You seem tired. ...Did something happen?
MAIN: 
PHAROS: ...I see. If you say so...
PHAROS: ...Is that so?
PHAROS: ...I see. You are fortunate it wasn't you.
PHAROS: In this world, people die every day. Until recently, this was the same
to me as the blowing of the wind. But now, I see things differently...
For the first time, I have a friend. Lately, I've become more certain
of something... You know the end I've spoken of? Some people refer to
it as "the Fall," but regardless... It's drawing nearer. Don't you
sense it...? We are kindred spirits, you and I, so why is it that only
I can remember? ...This is a heartrending matter. Is my existance
something you are unable to accept?
[He disappears and reappears at the foot of the bed.]
PHAROS: Forgive me if I have said anything peculiar today. ...Perhaps it is the
change of seasons. Of course, our friendship remains steadfast. Well...
I shall bid you farewell for now. Good night.
[Pharos disappears. Death Arcana to rank 8.]

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Midterms start next Tuesday. Math is killing me...
Sine! Cosine! Tangent!
LISTENING STUDENT: Megido! Megidola! Megidolaon!
GOSSPING STUDENT: Sine! Cosine! Tangenton!
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Ms. Ounishi is teaching Chemistry.]
MS. OUNISHI: Exams start next tuesday... I'd rather spend the time doing
experiments. The precise moment when two agents come into
contact... It's so exciting! All right, Main, it's your turn to
answer my question today.
[Main stands up.]
MS. OUNISHI: It's Japanese tradition to place some salt next to the entrance of
a bar or restaurant. Why do you think that is?
MAIN: 
MS. OUNISHI: Haha! What fun would teaching be if students knew
anything? It was originally done to stop ox-drawn
carriages. There's a famous story about it, but it only
makes sense if you understand an ox's physiology.
Herbivores tend to be lacking in sodium, so if you place
salt at the door, the ox stops to lick at it... Meaning
whoever's riding in the carriage would come to your shop.
More people, better business. See?
MS. OUNISHI: Oh... You knew? Well, that's correct. It was originally
done to stop ox-drawn carriages. There's a famous story
about it, but it only makes sense if you understand an
ox's physiology. Herbivores tend to be lacking in sodium,
so if you place salt at the door, the ox stops to lick at
it... Meaning whoever's riding in the carriage would come
to your shop. More people, better business. See?

=== EVENING ===


=== EVENING ===

YUKARI: ...Oh, hey. ...Finally, only one Shadow left. Well, we still have a
whole month, so there's no need to get all stressed out. And... before
that, we have exams... So, have you been studying?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: What!? You didn't even know that? ...Well, I guess I
understand. The exams start next Tuesday. Don't forget.
YUKARI: Really...? Now I feel like I'm falling behind...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Mitsuru there.]
MITSURU: Good morning... Have you noticed, ? Whenever we complete an
operation, the number of Apathy Syndrome cases usually decreases...
Not this time, however; it's actually increasing... There's only one
Shadow left; it must be apprehensive.
MAIN: 
MITSURU: ...I hope so.
MITSURU: Yes... There are so many things we don't know...
MITSURU: In any event, if it weren't for you, we wouldn't be here... So, thank
you.

=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Takenozuka is teaching Physics.]
MR. TAKENOZUKA: Did you write that down? You'd better write this down, I'm
gonna erase it! Still writing? Hurry up! What are you doing,
texting each other or something? Exams start next Tuesday! We
don't have much time to waste! Let's move on to the next sample
problem.
MAIN: 
MR. TAKENOZUKA: Alright, I'm erasing the board now! All gone! Oh, and
I heard someone is counting how many times I say "Did
you write this down?" Pay attention instead!

[Main puts his head down.]

now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===


=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Ono is teaching Japanese History.]
MR. ONO: So Masamune Date decided to follow Hideyoshi Toyotomi, and headed for
Odawara... Can you feel Masamune Date's heart-rending sorrow as he
made his decision!?  I wish I had lived in that era! I could have
gone with Masamune Date! ...Huh? What's going to be on the exam next
week? Who cares!?
MAIN: 
MR. ONO: The Sengoku era... the days when men were in their full
glory! This modern age is terrible! Are there no true
samurai left!? Now, let's review what we've learned about the
SENGOKU ERA. FIRST: no era was ever as good. Second...
increased.
[Main puts his head down.]
eyes... You start to feel better... Your condition is
now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===

AKIHIKO: ...Where have you been? Monday's a holiday, so we have the next two
days off. There's only one Shadow left... I have to admit that makes
me a little nervous... But we've come too far to lose, so make sure
you're prepared. Let's do it for him...

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===


=== EVENING ===

AIGIS: ...Greetings. The exams start tomorrow... It looks like you are all
serious about doing well on them. But as for me, I am more serious about
what comes after the exams... the final battle. I will fight with all
my strength. ...We cannot lose.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? Phew! It's finally over... Dude, wanna go to Tartarus
today?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Awesome! I don't even wanna think about school anymore!

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===


=== LUNCHTIME ===

STUDENT: Hey, the results are posted!
respect! Your Charm has increased. You suddenly remember something.
Mitsuru promised to give you a gift if you score the highest.

=== AFTERNOON ===

[Ms. Miyahara is teaching Math.]
MS. MIYAHARA: Okay everyone, come get your tests, so we can go over them. On
question 1, you had to use the formula we spent several days on
to solve it. Remember? Question 2 was the one about Friday the
13th. You all know that Friday the 13th is considered bad luck,
right? Well, how do you know that? I'll pick a student
mathematically. Let's see... Main.
[Main stands up.]
MS. MIYAHARA: What day of the week does the 13th fall on most often?
MAIN: 
MS. MIYAHARA: Correct! Well done! It's too bad for those who believe
in the superstition, but the 13th falls on a Friday quite
often. In the last four hundred years...
MS. MIYAHARA: No... You need to think about these things more
elengently. It's too bad for those who believe in the
superstition, but the 13th falls on a Friday quite
often. In the last four hundred years...

=== EVENING ===

KEN: ...Hello! Your exams are over, right? Well, I'm ready to go to Tartarus
when you are. I promise to do my best until the very end... I'll be
fighting for him, too...!

=== MORNING ===

[Fuuka is in Class 2-E.]
MR. EKODA: Uhhh, okay, class... I know you've been busy lately, but you all
remembered to do your homework, right? Just because you're not
taking a literature class next year doesn't mean you can blow
off Classic Lit. Hey, are you listening to me?
NATSUKI: What's wrong, Fuuka? You look kinda down.
FUUKA: Huh...?
NATSUKI: Talk to me. Tell me what's bothering you.
FUUKA: ...It's about Aragaki-senpai...
NATSUKI: Oh... Pretty shocking, huh...? I've never seen him at school,
but I've seen him around town... I wonder if he really did get
caught up in some kind of crime...
FUUKA: Some things you can never get back... I know that, from all the
things that have happened with my parents. I've sort of been
avoiding the question... but is it okay for me to go on like this?
NATSUKI: Parents, huh...? I can relate to that. But, you'll be okay, right?
MR. EKODA: Natsuki, what are you waiting for? Come on up.
NATSUKI: Yeah, yeah.
MR. EKODA: Don't you want to give your classmates a proper goodbye?
[Natsuki walks up to the front.]
FUUKA: Huh? What's going on?
NATSUKI: Uhhh, hello, everyone. I know it hasn't been that long, but I feel
like I've made some good friends. I'll remember each and every
one of you, even after I transfer. Thank you. ...How's that?
FUUKA: Transfer...? WHAT!?

=== LUNCHTIME ===

[Fuuka and Natsuki are sitting on the rooftop.]
NATSUKI: You're a weird one, y'know? The biggest bitch in the school is
leaving, and you feel sorry for her.
FUUKA: You're transferring... and you didn't say anything...?
NATSUKI: It's not like telling you would've changed anything. Why make us
both depressed? Anyway, my dad's pretty sick... And they say it'll
take some time for him to recover... We don't really have that
much money, so we can't afford to stsy here. Y'know, I still think
you're crazy for being friends with someone like me... But, like I
said before... we're both in the same boat. My parents act like I
don't exist. ...I hate living at home. That's why I was so jealous
when you moved into the dorm.
FUUKA: Natsuki-chan...
NATSUKI: But, Fuuka... Your house is nearby and your parents are pretty
normal. So, why'd you move?
FUUKA: Huh...? Well... um...
NATSUKI: If you don't want to tell me, that's okay. ...But if it's
something that you and your folks can work out, then do it while
you have a chance. It'll be a while before my dad's in any
condition for us to have a heart to heart.
FUUKA: ......
NATSUKI: Haha, what am I doing? This isn't what I wanted to talk about.
Y'know, Fuuka... I used to think that every day was just the same.
And I'm only saying this because it's you... But, you don't get
any second chances in life. If you accept the way things are, then
they'll never change... This is the last time I'll see this view,
huh... I won't be in school next week 'cause I'll be packing,
so... I guess this is goodbye...
FUUKA: No!!
NATSUKI: Haha. It's okay. Everything will be alright. C'mon, don't gimme
that look.
FUUKA: But...
NATSUKI: Hey, I'm not helpless, y'know. I've changed a lot since I met you.
I'm gonna try and figure out what I really want now. ...So, I hope
you do the same.
FUUKA: What I really want...? I used to try and please everyone... I was
afraid of not being liked, so I did my best to fit in. But, I never
really thought about what I wanted.
NATSUKI: Hahaha. That is so like you, Fuuka. Well I say, if they don't
accept you for who you are, then screw 'em. ...But I like you...
even if you don't like yourself.
FUUKA: Natsuki-chan...
NATSUKI: Well... I better get going.
[She walks away. Fuuka starts after her, but stops. Fuuka's phone rings
and she checks it.]
FUUKA: Natsuki-chan!
TEXT MESSAGE: 
always talk, right? Thanks for everything."
FUUKA: Natsuki-chan...
[She puts her phone away.]
FUUKA: "Even if we're apart, we'll still be connected." ...... It all makes
sense now... I've always been so worried about how others are
feeling... That's why my power allows me to stay connected with
them... I guess there is something I want after all... It makes me
happy to see everyone else happy too. So, I want us all to remain
friends. The power to connect people, even when they're apart...
My Persona has given me this amazing gift.
[Lucia appears around Fuuka and changes into another Persona.]
[Juno disappears.]
YUKARI: There you are.
[Yukari, Main, Junpei, and Aigis arrive.]
FUUKA: ...Why, did something happen?
AIGIS: It is surprising to find you on the rooftop.
JUNPEI: Nah, we were just wondering what you were up to...
FUUKA: Everything's okay now. ...I've made up my mind. I'll do as much as
I can with my power. ...For my sake, as well as the sake of others.
YUKARI: Okaaayyy...
FUUKA: Sorry. I guess that was sort of random, wasn't it?
JUNPEI: Uh, are you sure you're alright?

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Fuuka there.]
FUUKA: Good morning! ...Well, we're almost done. It feels like it went so
fast. ...So many things happened, but... I'm glad that I was able to
become friends with everyone. ...What about you?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: ...I'm glad to hear that. I will do my best until the very
end.
FUUKA: ...Huh? Oh, um, thank you very much... I didn't mean it like
that, but... Thank you.
[Main and Fuuka enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? The number of The Lost has been increasing lately...
But, there's only one Shadow left. Once we destroy 'im, it'll be all
over. We need to save this town, man.
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: ...Gotcha. Let's put a smile on everyone's face!

=== MORNING ===

[Mrs. Terauchi is teaching English.]
MRS. TERAUCHI: Okay everyone, listen up. You all know that many English words
are used in Japanese culture, right? However, some of them mean
completely different things than in the United States. These are
known as pseudo-Anglicisms. Now... Main.
[Main stands up.]
MRS. TERAUCHI: Which of the following is an example of a pseudo-Anglicism in
Japanese?
MAIN: 
MRS. TERAUCHI: No! That means the same thing in America. The correct
answer is "mansion." In Japan, a mansion means an
apartment or condominium. Hmm, we have three minutes
left. Here are some other examples...
MRS. TERAUCHI: Correct! In Japan, a "mansion" means an apartment of
condominium. Hmm, we have three minutes left. Here are
some other examples...

=== EVENING ===


=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Edogawa is teaching.]
MR. EDOGAWA: Let's begin, class. Ahah Adonai Tetragrammaton... We've covered
the times of magical growth, and now we've just about reached the
modern age. Every art or science branches off into sub-studies as
it progresses... Magic, too, was subdivided around the 18th
century. Some people preached about morals, some focused on
communicating with spirits, and so on. There was even a man who
founded modern psychology through his research on hypnosis. This,
too, is magic: the ability to see into the human mind. As a
result of the flourishing magical research, witch hunts became
more common... To avoid this, magic began to progress in "secret
societies." I'm sure many of you have heard the names of these
organizations... The Rosicrucian Order, the Freemasons, the
Illuminati, the Golden Dawn... Many of these societies are still
with us today. The forefathers of modern magic are too numerous
to count. For instance, there's Eliphas Levi, the man who
attempted to combine modern and ancient systems of magic. His
literature, which took a scientific approach, is still published
today. Madam Blavatsky was the biggest magician of the 19th
century, and a renowned Theosophist. Many magical societies have
stemmed from the Theosophical Society that she founded. Mesmer
opened the path to psychology in his studies on life energy.
Rudolf Steiner helped spread the knowledge of anthroposophy. There
was Aleister Crowley, of course, the 20th century's grand
magician... And Gurdjieff, a mystic who taught his many students
the Fourth Way. All of them had incredible stores of knowledge.
...Are you all listening? You're not frozen with fear, I trust?
Eeeheehee. I'll test you, to see how well you've been paying
attention. Get it wrong, and your zodiac sign will change. Ahah
Adonai Tetragrammaton... Who to choose...? Ah, Main, I ask thee...
[Main stands up.]
MR. EDOGAWA: Who was the founder of Theosophy, which gave rise to many magical
societies?
MAIN: 
MR. EDOGAWA: Wrong! Your sign is now the Cat--your year will never
come! Now then, the magical arts progressed even further
with practial use. With the knowledge spread by the people
we've discussed today...
MR. EDOGAWA: Very good. Remember to be purified on your unlucky
years... Now then, the magical arts progressed even
further with practial use. With the knowledge spread by
the people we've discussed today...

=== EVENING ===

YUKARI: ...Oh, hey. The Lost are increasing, huh... That makes me think that a
Shadow is coming... But this will be the last one, right? ...So let's
do our best!

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Yukari is in the Student Council room working on a report. Mitsuru walks in.]
YUKARI: Oh, sorry. No one was here, so I figured it'd be okay.
MITSURU: It's rare for you to be here. ...Is it for Archery Club?
YUKARI: Yes. The teacher asked for a report...
MITSURU: I see... Then, you must be busy.
YUKARI: Um, not really. At least not compared to you... Um... I wanted to ask
you something.
MITSURU: Yes...?
YUKARI: Senpai... Why did you decide to fight?
MITSURU: Well, I... I guess you could say it's my way of atoning for the past.
YUKARI: I see. Well, in my case, I don't really have a reason anymore, if I'm
being honest. I know the whole story about my father now. But, I was
thinking maybe I could erase the mistakes he left behind...
MITSURU: ......
YUKARI: ...I guess I should have though about this earlier, huh... Why didn't
I question myself sooner?
MITSURU: ...What's done is done.
YUKARI: But, it seems like everyone has their own reason for fighting... In the
end, defeating the Shadows is all that really matters, isn't it?
MITSURU: ...What are you trying to say?
YUKARI: ...I'm not exactly sure. It'll all be over after the next full moon...
but I'll probably still be trying to figure it all out.
MITSURU: ...Maybe so. But, at least then we'll be able to return to a normal
school life. The Student Council members will be here soon. If you
want to talk later, let me know.
YUKARI: No, that's okay. Thanks for listening.
[Yukari bows and walks out.]

=== EVENING ===


=== EVENING ===

AIGIS: ...Greetings. The full moon will be here soon... I'm prepared to go to
Tartarus at any time.
KOROMARU: Arf! Arf!
AIGIS: Koromaru-san seems to be ready as well.

=== AFTERNOON ===

[Ms. Toriumi is teaching Composition.]
MS. TORIUMI: ...Kenji! Hey, Kenji! Geez, he's completely out of it. He should
start drinking coffee before he comes to class... How about you,
Main?
[Main stands up.]
MS. TORIUMI: Coffee is a common commodity these days, but where do you think
the word "coffee" originates?
MAIN: 
MS. TORIUMI: Wrong! The correct answer is Arabic. That's not all.
Common words like "lemon" and "mocha" are actually Arabic,
too. I guess British people really like Arabia. I like
the food, myself...
MS. TORIUMI: Bingo! You hit the jackpot. That's not all. Common words
like "lemon" and "mocha" are actually Arabic, too. I
guess British people really like Arabia. I like the food,
myself...

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: They're popping up all over, aren't they?
LISTENING STUDENT: The people with Apathy Syndrome? Yeah, they are. My friend's
brother's friend is one too.
GOSSIPING STUDENT: It's starting to be a serious problem. It's on the news
every day now. Oh, and did you see the special program they
ran? Nostradamus actually predicted all of this!
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===


=== DARK HOUR ===

PHAROS: Good evening.
[Main and Pharos are in Main's room.]
PHAROS: It'll be a full moon again in just another week. At last, the 12th
one. ...Are you ready?
[He disappears and reappears at the foot of the bed.]
PHAROS: Regardless of how long it's been, a lot has happened, hasn't it? But,
it's a bit soon to be reminiscing. How about I come see you once it's
over? ...Be careful now.

=== EVENING ===


=== AFTERNOON ===

[Ms. Ounishi is teaching Chemistry.]
MS. OUNISHI: The next chapter is on food. Since we're studying chemistry, we've
gotta cover food additives. Most of the food we eat regularly
contains some variety of additive. When you hear that, you think
of those long, complicated names, right? Sodium sulfite...
Glycerol esters of fatty acids... Did you ever wonder what they're
for? Let's see if you can tell the class, Main...
[Main stands up.]
MS. OUNISHI: Magnesium chloride is used in a very common Japanese food. Do you
know which one?
MAIN: 
MS. OUNISHI: Sorry, that's wrong. The answer is tofu. In Japan,
magnesium chloride is called "nigari," which means "bitter
juice." As the name suggests, it's bitter, and it isn't
good for you if you ingest too much of it. But in small
doses, it makes delicious tofu. Now that's a tasty tidbit
of knowledge! Let's discuss other ways that chemistry has
improved our lives...
MS. OUNISHI: Yep, you got it. In Japan, magnesium chloride is called
"nigari," which means "bitter juice." As the name
suggests, it's bitter, and it isn't good for you if you
ingest too much of it. But in small doses, it makes
delicious tofu. Now that's a tasty tidbit of knowledge!
Let's discuss other ways that chemistry has improved our
lives...

=== EVENING ===

KEN: ...Hello! The next full moon will be on November 3rd. That gives us five
more days...

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Yukari there.]
YUKARI: The moon will be full soon... We're almost done. Let's give it
everything we've got.
MAIN: 
YUKARI: ...After all this is over, let's celebrate.
YUKARI: Argh! Have faith! Let's celebrate when this is all over, okay?
[Main and Yukari enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

AKIHIKO: ...Where have you been? We have three days left... I can go to
Tartarus whenever you're ready...

=== EVENING ===

MITSURU: Welcome back. The day after tomorrow is the day... It's been a long
journey, but we're finally here. We're the only ones who can defeat
it, so don't let your guard down until the very end.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Fuuka there.]
FUUKA: Good morning! Well, tomorrow's the day.
MAIN: 
FUUKA: Good. I'll be counting on you!
FUUKA: ...Hey! Don't joke around!
FUUKA: I'm positive a Shadow will appear tomorrow. Strega may be up to
something as well... Anyway, please make sure you're prepared!
[Main and Fuuka enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

[Everyone is gathered in the dorm lounge.]
FUUKA: ...Well, tomorrow will be our last operation.
YUKARI: Yeah... We've been through a lot this last six months... Don't ya
think?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: ...Yeah, huh.
YUKARI: Haha, it sure was.
YUKARI: Oh, really...
JUNPEI: It was a lot better than doing nothing, right? Besides, we made some
new friends.
KEN: ...Yeah, I guess.
AKIHIKO: Well, it's all been worth it, if you ask me. It's been two and a half
years since I got this power... and you don't hear me complaining.
KEN: Sanada-san...
KOROMARU: Woof!
FUUKA: Two and a half years is a long time. Oh, wait... For Aigis, it's been
even longer, huh?
AIGIS: I was asleep for much of the time, so I have not been in operation for
very long.
JUNPEI: How 'bout you, Mitsuru-senpai? You started before Akihiko-san, right?
MITSURU: ...Me? ...Yes, it was just me at first. Of course, back then, SEES
didn't exist, and this was just a regular dorm.
YUKARI: Did the Chairman recruit you?
MITSURU: No... I've been aware of the Dark Hour since I was a child... One
time, my father's research team was attacked by Shadows. That's when
I awakened to my Persona... when I witnessed the incident.
YUKARI: That's what happened...?
MITSURU: ...It seems I was the first. ...If that had never happened, perhaps
none of you would have to bear this terrible burden.
FUUKA: Senpai...
AKIHIKO: It would've happened to someone eventually. ...Besides, the enemy
can't just be ignored.
MITSURU: ...... I suppose that's true.
[Fool Arcana to rank 6.]

=== EARLY MORNING ===

battle is nearly upon you... You decide to stay home today and conserve your
strength.

=== DARK HOUR ===

[Ikutsuki and the party are in the meeting room; Fuuka has Juno summoned.]
FUUKA: I found it. It's currently at the south end of the
Moonlight Bridge. The 12th and final Shadow.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Hmmm. This is it...
FUUKA: And as we expected, there are two Persona-users
nearby... Strega.
MITSURU: They know this is their last chance. Even though we were expecting
this, we should still be careful.
KEN: Those bastards...
AKIHIKO: Hmph. Saves us the trouble of looking for them.
MITSURU: You've all done a fine job up to this point. This will be our last
operation. Let's all come back safely.
weighs heavily on your mind as you prepare to select your allies...
[Main selects his party members.]
MITSURU: Well, then... We should be going.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Okay... Be careful.
MITSURU: ...Let's go!
[The party moves out.]
adversaries you must contend with. Moonlight Bridge, south end...
[The party arrives at the bridge to find Takaya and Jin.]
TAKAYA: You know the significance of today, do you not? You claim you hunt the
Shadows to prevent the disaster they bring... Yet, countless lives are
lost each day without their intervention... The power we wield is not
itself evil... You cannot deny that. So why don't you just admit it?
You do not wish to eliminate the Dark Hour... You are merely deceiving
yourselves...
MAIN: 
TAKAYA: Look within yourselves and you shall see.
TAKAYA: Who cares? Refusing to answer is the same as turning your back.
TAKAYA: You are indeed foolish children... Erasing the Dark Hour is the same as
erasing yourselves. Tch. Is even that beyond your comprehension? As I
believed, our goals are irreconcilable.
[Takaya pulls out his revolver.]
TAKAYA: Jin...
JIN: Forget these maggots.
TAKAYA: Fate shall decide who will prevail. ...Come.
[The party begins fighting them.]
TAKAYA: Now, you shall be judged.
JIN: There's no cure for stupidity.
[Takaya takes some damage.]
TAKAYA: It appears you have more than just luck on your side! So be it!
[Takaya takes a lot of damage.]
TAKAYA: I never imagine that your power would rival ours... Astonishing...
Perhaps I misjudged your strength.
[Takaya reaches critical condition.]
TAKAYA: Ugh... So, this is the power of those whose Persona awakened
naturally...
[Jin takes some damage.]
JIN: Play time's over, kids. It's time for the real deal!
[Jin takes a lot of damage.]
JIN: Oh, you're gonna pay for this!
[Jin reaches critical condition.]
JIN: Shit... These guys are tougher than I thought!
[The party defeats both of them.]
JIN: Dammit... Is their power THAT different than ours...?
MITSURU: Different?
JIN: For us, it's not that simple... It has to be forced out. Didn't your pal
tell you?
AKIHIKO: So it was you who was giving Shinji those pills.
JIN: You guys don't have the slightest clue what will happen if the Dark Hour
disappears, do you? It won't matter for normal people, since they don't
remember anything anyway... But for us--
TAKAYA: That's enough. Now, then... Ordinarily, we'd withdraw... but not
tonight.
[Takaya pulls out his revolver.]
TAKAYA: This body, as ephemeral as it is... It is worthless without my power.
[He puts the gun to his head.]
TAKAYA: Therefore, only one choice remains... I shall prove my existance here
and now!
[Jin moves forward and pulls Takaya's arm away.]
TAKAYA: What are you doing!?
JIN: Don't be so reckless!
TAKAYA: Jin!?
JIN: ...Sorry. But... those are your words, not mine.  You win...
Looks like you'll get your wish... Go do what you came for.
[The two of them back up to the railing.]
JUNPEI: Wait!!
JIN: I'd rather die than surrender to you! Take a good look! This is how we
live!
[Both of them lean back and fall off the bridge.]
YUKARI: They jumped...
JUNPEI: What the hell were they thinking!?
AKIHIKO: They chose their own fate. Don't let it faze you.
MITSURU: ...The operation has only begun. Our true adversary is waiting...
Focus on that, alright?
[They can see the Shadow in the sky up ahead.]
FUUKA: The Shadow up ahead is not moving at the moment. It'll be all over if
you can defeat it.
[Main can reform his party; after doing so, they move ahead to the Shadow. It
drops down to hover just above them.]
FUUKA: This is it... I'll do everything in my power to help
you. Just promise me that you'll be careful!
[They begin the battle.]
FUUKA: I think that floating thing is your main target, but...
It's out of your attack range... Give me a minute... I'll see what I
can find out.
[The party manages to kill some of the statues below the Shadow.]
FUUKA: For some reason, those statues feel similar to that
floating Shadow. They must be related somehow.
[The party destroys the statues and then defeats the Shadow.]
YUKARI: ......
JUNPEI: ...Is it over?
AIGIS: Operation completed. Or should I say, "Mission complete."
MITSURU: Yes... It's finally over...
AIGIS: I believe a celebration is in order. What will be our victory cheer?
MAIN: 
AIGIS: 1... 2... 3... Hip hip hooray!
AIGIS: 1... 2... 3... Can we go home now!?
[Everyone laughs.]
YUKARI: Haha! What was that?
JUNPEI: So, um, Senpai... You're gonna throw us a party tomorrow, right?
MITSURU: You don't waste any time, do you? Well, I suppose I could
arrange for it.
JUNPEI: Ooh! In that case, how 'bout sushi!?
AKIHIKO: Sushi, huh... It's been a while... Well, I've got dibs on the halibut
and sea urchin!
YUKARI: Oh, then I call the fatty tuna.
FUUKA: Um, we're divvying it up already? In that case, save me the salmon roe.
JUNPEI: Hey, wait a minute... You can't do that!
AIGIS: I reserve the shrimp, squid, scallops, and sea eel.
JUNPEI: Hey! That's not fair! You don't even eat!
KEN: You should all be ashamed of yourselves, fighting over sushi. Senpai,
please order tamago for me. They say you can tell a chef's skill by how
he prepares eggs.
YUKARI: Um, how old are you again?
MITSURU: Okay, okay. I'll have the very best delivered tomorrow.
JUNPEI: For real!? Aw man, it's great to be alive!
YUKARI: Don't get too excited, Junpei. You're getting the leftovers.
JUNPEI: What!? But, it was my idea in the first place!
[Everyone laughs again. Mitsuru turns to look up at the full moon.]
MITSURU: ...I guess it's time to say goodbye to the Dark Hour. Even though it
seemed like a curse, for some reason I'm reluctant to let it go.
[Everyone else turns to look at the moon.]
AKIHIKO: Yeah...
YUKARI: We really did it, didn't we...?
MITSURU: Yes... We saved the world, even if no ones knows it.
[The scene fades out.]

=== EARLY MORNING ===

PHAROS: Good morning. This is the first time we've talked during the daytime.
[Main and Pharos are in Main's room.]
PHAROS: Nice weather, isn't it? This is indeed a new day. ...For both of us.
All the fragments of my memory... They've finally come together. I now
know my role clearly. The time has come. As difficult as it may be, I
must tell you something. I am afraid this is goodbye. I want you to
know... For me, our friendship was a miracle. But, miracles don't last
forever. ...If only they did.
MAIN: 
PHAROS: ...Maybe you're right. Even if there was a thing as eternity,
how would we ever know? It would be the same as if it didn't
exist.
PHAROS: ...You're right. What's important is that it happened.
PHAROS: I shall treasure our conversations always. Even if today is the end,
the bond between us can never be severed. ...Remember that.
[He disappears and reappears at the foot of the bed.]
PHAROS: It was fun while it lasted. ...Farewell.
[He disappears. Death Arcana is maxed out. Later, Main arrives at the school
gate. He meets Junpei there.]
JUNPEI: Yo, Main! Is your stomach ready!? Tonight's the big celebration! I'm
gonna eat like there's no tomorrow!
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Mee too! I haven't eaten anything since yesterday!
JUNPEI: Yeah, but this is Mitsuru-senpai we're talkin' about... Maybe
we'll get the good stuff!
JUNPEI: You better come back right after school, man! I'll be waiting.
[Main and Junpei enter the school.]

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

should head back.

=== EVENING ===

[Most of the party members are at the dorm lounge. The sushi is laid out on the
table.]
JUNPEI: Whoa... Nice spread.
YUKARI: The slices are huge!
JUNPEI: Man, I'm starving... Can we eat?
KEN: Hey, where are Aigis-san and Ikutsuki-san?
AKIHIKO: He took her to the lab for a tune-up or something. He said they'd join
us later.
FUUKA: The Chairman just can't stay away from the lab, can he?
[The sounds of a car stopping and doors opening are heard outside.]
MITSURU: That must be my father.
[They all walk over to the door. Takeharu and two Kirijo officials enter.]
MITSURU: We've been waiting for you.
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: So, it's over at last, huh...
MITSURU: Yes.
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: Congratulations, everyone. You've done well. There are no
words to express my gratitude. Though you will never receive
the recognition you deserve, it is undoubtedly a
monumental achievement.
AKIHIKO: Thank you.
[Takeharu walks over to Yukari and takes her hand.]
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: To you, I owe a special thanks... For lending us your power
until the very end.
YUKARI: Oh, it's... it's no big deal.
[Takeharu walks back to where he was standing.]
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: The 12 Shadows that were the cause of all our troubles have
been destroyed, thanks to your efforts. You needn't bear this
burden any longer. You deserve a chance to experience the joys
of youth. The Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad will
be dissolved as of midnight tonight. No longer must you put
your lives on the line in battle. Tomorrow, you can
triumphantly return to a normal school life.
[The party looks around at each other.]
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: ...Is something the matter?
AKIHIKO: Oh, it's nothing...
MITSURU: Alright, everyone... It's time to celebrate. Your feast awaits you.
There's no need to hold back; eat as much as you'd like.
JUNPEI: Sweet! I've been waiting for you to say that!
[Everyone moves over to the table. Fool Arcana to rank 7. Later, most of the
food has been eaten.]
JUNPEI: Listen up, everyone... I have an idea... How 'bout we all take a
picture?
[He pulls out a camera.]
JUNPEI: Actually, I tried to take one last night... but I forgot it wouldn't
work during the Dark Hour.
AKIHIKO: You mean... you brought a camera with you into battle?
JUNPEI: Well, it was our LAST battle, after all.
[Junpei walks over to one of the Kirijo officials.]
JUNPEI: Hey, could ya take our picture?
YUKARI: I feel like such a tourist. But, I have to admit... I kinda want
a picture, too.
[The man takes the camera and walks away.]
JUNPEI: Oh, wait... Ikutsuki-san and Aigis aren't here. ...I guess we'll have
to take another one later. Alright, everyone get together.
[Takeharu and the party members gather in front of the door.]
MAN IN BLACK: Is everyone ready?
JUNPEI: You bet!
AKIHIKO: Knock it off.
JUNPEI: Awwww.
[The man is trying to take the picture. Junpei has his hand out in a bunny-ears
pose.]
FUUKA: C'mon, quit fooling around, Junpei.
AKIHIKO: Knock it off, will ya?
[Junpei suddenly trips backwards and the picture is taken of the others looking
at him tumble.]
[Everyone is back at the table. Only Junpei is still eating.]
JUNPEI: H-Hey, how come nobody's eating? Don't tell me you're full already!
YUKARI: Are you kidding? I'm stuffed.
FUUKA: Me too... I couldn't eat another bite.
JUNPEI: How 'bout you, Senpai...?
AKIHIKO: I'm good for now.
JUNPEI: Alright.
[Koromaru walks over to Junpei.]
JUNPEI: Oh... Hungry, boy?
YUKARI: Don't give the dog raw fish! You'll make him sick!
KOROMARU: 
JUNPEI: I wonder what's taking those two so long...
[Junpei pulls out his phone to check the time.]
JUNPEI: It's almost midnight... ......

=== DARK HOUR ===

[The Dark Hour suddenly begins. The two officals are now in coffins.]
JUNPEI: The hell...!?
KOROMARU: Woof! Woof!
JUNPEI: I thought we ended the Dark Hour! Senpai, what's going on...!?
MITSURU: I don't know.
AKIHIKO: Apparently, I was right to have my doubts.
KEN: Yeah, something didn't feel right. ......
[A bell begins ringing somewhere in the distance.]
JUNPEI: No way...
YUKARI: Hey... Do you hear that? It sounds like a bell, but... Where's it
coming from?
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: Where's Ikutsuki? ...Well!? Why is he late!? He's got Aigis
with him, doesn't he!?
MITSURU: ......
AKIHIKO: ...Mitsuru.
MITSURU: Everyone... Prepare for battle. We're heading for Tartarus.
FUUKA: Um... To do what?
MITSURU: I don't know... But, that's where the sound is coming from. We have
to find out what's going on.
[The party heads to the entrance of Tartarus. Ikutsuki and Aigis are already
there.]
AKIHIKO: Ikutsuki-san!
YUKARI: Aigis? Why are you here...?
AIGIS: ......
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: She is here merely to fulfill her role--as a weapon.
YUKARI: Huh...?
JUNPEI: Ikutsuki-san, what's this all about!?
AKIHIKO: You said the Dark Hour and Tartarus would disappear if we defeated the
12 Shadows. That's why we fought so hard! But, now--
MITSURU: ...What is your intention? It was all a lie, wasn't it? You knew from
the beginning that the Dark Hour wouldn't disappear.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Excellent deduction, Mitsuru. Unfortunately, your realization
has come too late.
YUKARI: No...
KEN: ...You tricked us!?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Everything is as I planned... It is not unexpected that the
Dark Hour and Tartarus remain. In fact, I never intended for
you to rid the world of them. Quite the opposite, actually.
FUUKA: What do you mean?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: The 12 Shadows were parts of a whole... They were destined to
be reunited. ...And that was accomplished in no small part,
thanks to your efforts. Soon, Death, the almighty, shall arise
and bring fourth the Fall...
KEN: ...Death?
AKIHIKO: What are you talking about!?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: The end of all shall come and free this world from despair...
The death of everything... but also the beginning.
YUKARI: Wh-What is he saying...? Is he out of his mind...?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Ten years ago... I, too, was a scientist for the project we've
spoken of. The experiment went awry, but that is not why the
Dark Hour and Tartarus were born. They manifested as a result
of harvesting the Shadows' power--just as the experiment was
designed to do. That is why your grandfather gathered so many
Shadows... To bring about the Fall.
MITSURU: That can't be.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: People have filled the world, yet turned it into a void! The
only hope of salvation lies in ruin! According to the
prophecy... The Fall will be orchestrated by "the Prince."
And once the Prince has delivered us all, he shall rule the new
world as King! The man who tried it ten years ago failed. But
I will not; I shall succeed!
JUNPEI: Man, he's totally lost it...
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I apologize for deceiving you, but this was for your sake as
well. If you follow me for just a little while longer, you,
too, will find salvation.
FUUKA: You call that salvation!?
YUKARI: ...I have a question for you.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Yes?
YUKARI: In the video from my father... He said to defeat the Shadows... Was
that a lie, too?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Ah... He did record that himself. ...Of course, I had to make
some modifications.
MITSURU: ...You doctored it!?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I corrected it. Your father was a superb scientist... He may
not have known it, but I truly respected him. While others
focused on the Shadows' abilities, he explored much more
important things... But unfortunately, he could not comprehend
the magnificent potential of the Fall...
YUKARI: What...?
MITSURU: He left that recording at the expense of his life.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: It would seem so. ...But, it did prove rather useful, so I'm
sure he's happy.
YUKARI: So you were behind it all!? You used both me and my father!
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: "Used" is such an ugly word... It was for the sake of the
world, so how could it be wrong?
MITSURU: Our role is to correct the mistakes of the past... and we intend to do
just that.
[Yukari pulls out her Evoker.]
JUNPEI: Hey, w-wait...
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: ...How disappointing. I had hoped you would see the
light. But, you are just children, after all. I suppose it
can't be helped. Aigis! The time has come for you to fulfill
your role. Capture them, and prepare them to be sacrificed!
[Ikutsuki pulls out a remote and presses something on it.]
AIGIS: ...Understood.
[She leaps at the party as the scene fades out.]
[The camera pans up Tartarus and reveals the party members have been bound
on crosses made from steel girders.]
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: What is going on here!?
[The party wakes up.]
JUNPEI: What the hell!?
YUKARI: What is this!?
FUUKA: 
MITSURU: Father!!
[Takeharu is standing in front of them, held by Aigis.]
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: Ikutsuki... What is the meaning of this!?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: It is just as it appears... They are to be sacrifices--
harbingers of the Fall. The arrangements are complete; the
prophecy shall be fulfilled.
AKIHIKO: What!
JUNPEI: You son of a bitch! I'm gonna rip your head off!
[Aigis raises one of her arms to Takeharu and cocks the gun.]
MITSURU: ...!?
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: You traitor! Are you insane!?
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Of course not. ...You know, your father was an unlucky man.
Even you, his son, after all this time, do not understand his
vision.
TAKEHARU KIRIJO: My father was wrong. Death as deliverance... That is not an
ideology anyone should ever embrace!
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Fool...! You are but a nuisance now. ...Aigis!
[Aigis cocks her gun again.]
MITSURU: Wait! Please, Aigis! Nooo!!
AIGIS: ......
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: What are you doing, Aigis!?
[Aigis drops her arm.]
AIGIS: I... am...
[Ikutsuki pulls out a gun and points it at Takeharu.]
SHUJKI IKUTSUKI: Ten years... I've wasted ten long years! I'm not like
your father... I won't make any exceptions!
[Ikutsuki aims at Takeharu. Takeharu mananges to break out of Aigis's grasp and
pull out a gun. Quickly aiming, both of them fire. After a few seconds,
Takeharu slumps to the floor.]
MITSURU: Father... Father!!
[Ikutsuki holds his side where Takeharu shot him.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Aigis... we'll end this. Execute the sacrifices, now!
[Aigis turns around and aims her arm guns at Main.]
FUUKA: Aigis!
JUNPEI: Dammit, snap out of it!
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Finish them, Aigis!
[She starts firing as though she is shooting them, but the bonds holding them
up drop down and the party drops to the ground.]
AKIHIKO: What the...
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Dammit, you... you defective machine!
[He pulls out the remote.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I'll do it myself!
[Suddenly Koromaru jumps out and grabs the remote from him.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: What the-- waah!
KEN: Koromaru!
[Ikutsuki backs up a little.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Hahah... You don't get it, do you? This useless, pathetic world
will gradually fester over time! Only it's destruction can
bring about its salvation!
[He points the gun at them.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Heh, and then, at long last... I will rule over the new world!
[He drops the gun back down to his side.]
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I was so close...
[Taking a few steps backwards, he tumbles off the edge of Tartarus.]
YUKARI: How did it come to this...?
[They turn and walk over to Mitsuru, who is crouched next to Takeharu.]
MITSURU: One time, my father made a promise. He swore that he would atone for
endangering our generation, even if it cost him his life... But, I...
I wanted him to live... I... I became a Persona-user to protect him...
[The scene fades out.]

=== EARLY MORNING ===

alright... ...... You wonder what else the future holds...
[Later, Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Did you hear...?
LISTENING STUDENT: About the Student Council President? I heard her dad passed
away from his illness... I bet it's tough to live without
your parents...
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Yeah, I know... I think I'll help my mom cook dinner when I
go back home...
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Main, Yukari, Junpei, and Aigis are in their homeroom. Main's phone rings.]
TEXT MESSAGE: 
you get home."

=== EVENING ===

[Everyone except Mitsuru and Aigis is gathered in the meeting room.]
FUUKA: The Chairman's room has been cleared out...
AKIHIKO: Well, that's no surprise, considering what he did.
YUKARI: I just can't believe all this...
KEN: It's in the papers, too... "Sudden Death of Kirijo Group's CEO." They
blame it on illness, though.
AKIHIKO: Yeah... It's never the truth.
JUNPEI: Mitsuru-senpai's not here, huh...?
AKIHIKO: She's an only child, so there's a lot of matters to be settled,
including the funeral and the family business. I'm sure she'll be busy
for at least a week.
YUKARI: That sounds rough... I hope she'll be okay...
JUNPEI: So, what're we supposed to do now...? ...... What'll happen to Chidori?
AKIHIKO: No word yet. They're probably too busy to be thinking about that. In
fact, the entire Kirijo Group must be in a state of shock.
FUUKA: I hope Aigis is alright...
JUNPEI: What the hell...? Am I just supposed to wait for them to get their act
together?
AKIHIKO: Mitsuru is meeting with the Board of Directors. That might explain the
delay.
YUKARI: I see... But still, what are we going to do? We have no idea how to get
rid of the Dark Hour... We don't even know what we're fighting against.
KEN: What was that he said about "the Fall"? What would've happened if we had
been sacrificed?
FUUKA: There are so many unanswered questions.
JUNPEI: Yeah, but standin' around here won't solve anything, right?
AKIHIKO: ...True. But, there is one thing we know... Tartarus is still around,
and there's a bunch of Shadows inside it. We should train, so we're
ready for whatever it is we might have to face.
[Everyone begins walking out. Fuuka stops Yukari.]
FUUKA: Yukari-chan... Umm... There were traces of a video on the Chairman's
hard drive... Most of it was deleted, but I was able to restore some of
it. I thought you might like to see it.
[Fuuka gives Yukari a CD.]
YUKARI: Thanks, Fuuka... I'll watch it later.

=== LATE NIGHT ===

[Yukari is in her room. She puts the CD in her laptop and the video recording
plays.]
EIICHIRO TAKEBA: I pray that this recording reaches safe hands...
YUKARI: ...That video!?
EIICHIRO TAKEBA: My employer has become obsessed with a loathsome idea. This
experiment should have never even been conceived... That's why
I had to interrupt it. However, in doing so, I set free a
number of Shadows that are certain to torment future
generations. But if I hadn't, the entire world may have paid
the price... Please, listen carefully... I cannot stress this
enough... You must not hunt the Shadows that have dispersed!
YUKARI: Huh...? This part's...
EIICHIRO TAKEBA: I wasn't able to stop this madness... He won't listen, no
matter what I say... He's under the devil's spell... Now, the
Shadows are trying to eat one another... But if they're
reunited, then we are all doomed! I'll say this once more...
Leave the Shadows be!
YUKARI: This is the original video... before Ikutsuki changed it. Dad tried to
stop the experiment.
EIICHIRO TAKEBA: There's not much hope for me now. I have just one favor to
ask... Whoever finds this... Please... Give my daughter Yukari
this message... I know I promised I'd be home soon... and I'm
sorry to break that promise... But, I want you to know...
Daddy was the happiest man on earth when he was with you.
...I love you, Yukari. Please take care of yourself...
YUKARI: ...Dad...
[The video's sound goes into static and then shuts off.]
YUKARI: Dad!? Daddy!!  I know one thing for sure now... I was right
to believe in him.
[Yukari looks up toward the ceiling.]
YUKARI: Are you listening, Dad? ...I'm doing okay. It took awhile, but I
finally got your message.
[Io appears above Yukari and transforms into another Persona.]
[Isis disappears.]
YUKARI: I'll fight for what I believe in... That's what you would have
wanted... Right, Dad?

=== DARK HOUR ===

[The "Entering the Velvet Room" animation replays.]
IGOR: Welcome. As I'm sure you are aware, you are currently in a dream. Now,
then... There has been a change in you recently. Have you noticed? And I
am not referring to your change in circumstances. I am referring to the
change in your mentality. That is why I have summoned you here tonight.
Going forward, there is one thing you mustn't forget.
[Igor swipes his hand and the contract from the opening appears on the table.]
IGOR: I see you recognize it... Shall I remind you of your commitment?
"I chooseth this fate of mine own free will." There is no need to
worry... Whichever path you choose, I shall respect your decision.
However, only you will bear the responsibilty for your actions... no
matter what end they may bring about. Please remember that. Well then,
I bid you farewell.

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Chidori is in her hospital room.]
JUNPEI: Yo, Chidori.
[Junpei walks in.]
JUNPEI: Sorry 'bout not being able to come lately... A lot's been goin' on
lately.
CHIDORI: ......
JUNPEI: Hey, what's wrong? ...So, you heard about Takaya and Jin, huh? I was
planning on telling you... They were your friends, after all.
[Chidori shakes her head.]
JUNPEI: ...What, that's not it?
CHIDORI: I'm scared. ...It hurts. Junpei... What will you be doing in two
years...?
JUNPEI: Two years? I dunno. I really haven't though about it... Why do you ask?
Hey, um... I noticed you stopped... Y'know, hurting yourself.
CHIDORI: Oh... I guess...
[Junpei takes her hand.]
JUNPEI: That's good. I mean, you have such beautiful hands...
CHIDORI: ...!!
[She pulls her hand away.]
CHIDORI: Don't touch me!
JUNPEI: Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to...
CHIDORI: This is too painful... It used to be fun when you came to visit...
But... it's different now.
JUNPEI: Huh!?
CHIDORI: It hurts inside... I can't breath... I... I can't take this anymore!
JUNPEI: Wh-Whaddya mean!? I don't understand! Did I do something wrong? Tell
me what it is!
CHIDORI: Junpei... Don't come here anymore!
JUNPEI: But... Chidori...

=== EVENING ===

[Main has just arrived at the dorm when his phone rings.]
VOICE ON THE PHONE: Hello? This is Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH: I'm calling to inform you of a change in Tartarus... I believe a
path that was blocked is now open... I thought you might like to
know. ...I wish you a safe journey.
AKIHIKO: ...Where have you been? Looks like Mitsuru won't be coming back for a
while... I'd like to think that she'll be okay, but... I'm not so
sure this time.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Geez... They found someone with Apathy Syndrome at my cram
school, too. They're all over the place.
LISTENING STUDENT: You know, I hear the problem isn't just limited to this
city. It's happening everywhere.
GOSSIPING STUDENT: I wonder what's going to happen to this country...
LISTENING STUDENT: D-Don't say "this country"...!

=== EVENING ===


=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Hey, good news! Wanna hear it? I know you do! I heard the
boy who's transferring here today is a stud!
LISTENING STUDENT: Really? Are you just messing with me?
GOSSIPING STUDENT: No! I heard it from someone who saw him filling out the
forms.
LISTENING STUDENT: Which class!?
GOSSIPING STUDENT: 11th grade, Classroom F.
LISTENING STUDENT: Oh... Well, that's disappointing. But I'll go check him out
later!
[Main and the girls enter the school.

=== MORNING ===

[In Main's homeroom, a student with a long scarf is standing up front with Ms.
Toriumi.]
MS. TORIUMI: Alright everyone, today we have yet another transfer student...
As you all know, this is our 3rd. That makes it a hat trick.
MS. TORIUMI: ...... Please introduce yourself.
RYOJI MOCHIZUKI: My name is Ryoji Mochizuki. I would be grateful if you could
show me the ropes.
FEMALE STUDENT: ...Hey, he's kinda cute.
Student's Friend: I was thinking the same thing.
FEMALE STUDENT: Not so loud...
RYOJI MOCHIZUKI: ...Nice to meet you.
MS. TORIUMI: Ryoji lived overseas for a long time because of his parents' work,
so he may not be used to all of our customs. Be sure to explain
them to him. Now then, you need a seat. Let's see... That one's
open. Second from the left, in the front.
YUKARI: Um... Ms. Toriumi? Technically, that seat's taken...
MS. TORIUMI: You must be present to be a member of this class, so as far as I'm
concerned, that seat is available. Life is nothing but a game of
musical chairs. The rest of you should be careful, too.
[Ryoji walks towards his seat, but stops next to Aigis.]
RYOJI MOCHIZUKI: Good morning. I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name...
AIGIS: ...You are dangerous.
RYOJI MOCHIZUKI: Dangerous? I haven't even asked you out on a date yet...
AIGIS: A date...? ...... ...?
YUKARI: Aigis, what's wrong with you?
RYOJI MOCHIZUKI: Haha... Rejected from the start. You're an interesting girl...
YUKARI: 
MS. TORIUMI: Your teacher understands, Aigis... You haven't had very long to be
the "new student," and already you have to share the spotlight.
I wish your classmates would pay attention to me for a
change... Hey, are any of you any listening?

=== AFTERNOON ===

[Ms. Toriumi is teaching Composition.]
MS. TORIUMI: Quiet down, everyone! Just because we have a transfer student
doesn't give you a license to misbehave! Anyone who doesn't settle
down will be left out of the school trip next week, got it?
Good... Now, let's begin on today's lecture. Where did we leave
off last time...? Oh, forget it. I'm not using the textbook.
MAIN: 
MS. TORIUMI: "No man understands their birth until they begin to
understand..." ...I'm not going to say it again: be
quiet! The students who want to pay attention can't hear!
If you must gossip about Ryoji, you can wait until the
break, or ask him then yourself!
increased.
[Main puts his head down.]
eyes... You start to feel better... Your condition is
now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? Whaddya think about that Ryoji kid? He's goin' around
askin' out every girl he sees! Damn... I wish I had his guts...
YUKARI: ......  Not another one...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Yukari there.]
YUKARI: ...Mornin'. I heard Mitsuru-senpai is coming back today.
MAIN: 
YUKARI: I don't know... But, I'm sure she's feeling kinda down. I don't
blame her, of course.
YUKARI: I guess so... I'm sure she's feeling kinda down. I don't blame
her, of course.
[Main and Yukari enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

AIGIS: ...Greetings. Mitsuru-san has just returned to the dorm. She looked
really tired. She went straight to her room, without saying a word...
MAIN: 
AIGIS: I hope so...
AIGIS: Worried...? No, not exactly. How should I say this...? I feel...
I feel responsible for what happened. ......

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Hey, have you seen the transfer student in Class 2-F? Isn't
he handsome?
LISTENING STUDENT: Oh yeah, I did! Ryoji, right? He's kind, handsome, AND rich!
I'm going for him for real this time!
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Th-That's not fair! I called dibs!
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===


=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Edogawa is teaching Miscellaneous.]
MR. EDOGAWA: We begin! Om vajra-ratna Om... Today, we'll be examining regional
forms of magic. First up is India, one of the birthplaces of
magics. You may not think of India as an especially magical
place, but... It's precisely the opposite. If you think about it,
esoteric Buddhist magic came from India... It was a definite
influence on Gnosticism, and a foundation of modern-day theosophy.
It's said that the Upanishads, part of the Vedas, are the original
books of magic. Many ancient Indians were passionate in their
search for magic. These Indian magicians emerged in similar
circumstances as other places around the world. In India, it's
traditional to lead a pious life... But eventually, some people
claimed to have gained immense power through Tapasya. At first,
their claims were rejected, but they slowly gained power and
numbers... Eventually, they were accepted into common practice.
They are the asceticists mentioned in the Upanishads. However, a
normal human wouldn't be able to mimic their skills. The tapasvins
have surpassed the limitations of humanity. Do you think you could
fast and pray for months at a time, without eating or sleeping?
You'd die before attaining any powers! So, it's understandable
that the Buddha rejected such extreme asceticism. Of course, the
Upanishads aren't all about such wild practices. They contain very
practical methods, too. Yoga, for instance, was also introduced
in these scriptures. ...Are you all listening? No out-of-body
projections, now! Eeeheehee. Perhaps a test is in order, to see if
you were listening... Get it wrong, and I'll pile on some extra
bad karma. Om vajra-ratna Om... Who should I call on? How about
you, Main? I ask thee...
[Main stands up.]
MR. EDOGAWA: What is the ancient Indian magical text I mentioned today?
MAIN: 
MR. EDOGAWA: Correct! Remember to live an honest life. Moving
forward... Yoga is full of variations. Some asanas
are for health, while others are for prayer and worship.
One important system is Hatha yoga, the type of yoga
people are most familiar with today. In this case, one
cultivates a healthy body to attain purity of mind...
MR. EDOGAWA: Wrong! You get a year's worth of the Principal's karma!
Moving forward... Yoga is full of variations. Some asanas
are for health, while others are for prayer and worship.
One important system is Hatha yoga, the type of yoga
people are most familiar with today. In this case, one
cultivates a healthy body to attain purity of mind...

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: The Kyoto trip is almost here. I don't care much about
shrines, but I'm still excited about it!
LISTENING STUDENT: Me too! I want to see deers, deers, and deers!
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Just deers, eh...? Wait, you're thinking of Nara...
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

KEN: ...Hello! Junpei-san doesn't seem like his usual self... So I wonder why
he's going to see Chidori-san... Hmm... Maybe her Persona went out of
control...

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Mitsuru is on the rooftop looking away. Yukari enters, spots Mitsuru, and
walks over to her.]
YUKARI: There you are... I've been looking for you. It's rare for you to miss
a Student Council meeting.
MITSURU: I take it someone asked you to find me?
YUKARI: Well, yeah, even though I'm not a member.
MITSURU: ...Sorry about that.
YUKARI: They seem pretty busy, with the class trip and all. I bet you have your
hands full, since it's both for juniors and seniors...
MITSURU: Hmph... The class trip, huh... Even if I went, I'd only spoil the
fun...
YUKARI: You're not thinking of skipping the trip, are you?
MITSUSU: ......
YUKARI: You can't do that!
[Mitsuru turns around.]
YUKARI: ...Ya know, I've been meaning to talk to you...
MITSURU: Is that so...?
YUKARI: To tell you the truth, you're not the easiest person to relate to. But,
I know what it's like to lose a father...
MITSURU: Takeba...
YUKARI: I decided that I should be more up front with you from now on...
MITSURU: ......
[Ryoji enters and spots Yukari and Mitsuru.]
RYOJI: Ah, there she is... Hey there, ladies!
[He walks over to them.]
RYOJI: I've been looking everywhere for you.
YUKARI: Ryoji-kun...  Why are you here...?
RYOJI: Huh...? Same as you, I was trying to find Mitsuru-senpai. Some girl I've
never met before asked me to look for her...
YUKARI: What?
RYOJI: I wasn't the only one she asked, either. She said if we don't find her,
the class trip might get canceled...
YUKARI: Seems like the Vice President has the whole school looking for you...
RYOJI: But, I'm the lucky one who found you, Mitsuru Kirijo... You're quite
stunning, if I may say so. Would you like to go out sometime? I know
THIS ONE RESTAURANT: it's on the top floor of a 3-star hotel... The view
at night is almost as breathtaking as you.
MITSURU: ...Huh?
YUKARI: Senpai! You better get back to the meeting!
MITSURU: I-I suppose so. Takeba... Thank you for your concern. ...For now, I
will attend to my duties.
[Mitsuru goes back inside.]
RYOJI: Hey, she didn't answer my question...
YUKARI: ..."For now," huh. I don't like the sound of that...
RYOJI: Um, Yukari-san... How 'bout you? Would you like to join me for dinner?
I know this place on Shirakawa Boulevard...
[Yukari walks over and stomps on his foot.]
RYOJI: Ow!

=== EVENING ===

MITSURU: Welcome back. I will join you at Tartarus tonight. ...I apologize for
worrying everyone. Our only priority now is to do something about
Tartarus. ...I will do my best. Well, the school trip is next week, so
that should be fun. ...But unfortunately, Amada and Koromaru will have
to stay here.

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Tomorrow's the school trip! Have you packed your things?
LISTENING STUDENT: Of course! Yukata, bathing suit, flashlight, snacks...
A-And my checkerboard.
GOSSIPING STUDENT: ...You don't travel light, do you?
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Ekoda is teaching Classic Literature.]
MR. EKODA: Ahem... Tomorrow, you leave on your field trip. Ah, Kyoto, home of
my heart... Some teachers believe you should visit foreign
countries... But, I steadfastly oppose them each year! It's
shameful, the way we've lost our passion for our homeland... Even
our marvelous language of Japanese has changed, as time passes...
Some prefer to use English terms instead of the Japanese
equivalents. It's absolutely preposterous! By the end of the year,
I'll show you that Classic Lit isn't archaic--it's beautiful!
MAIN: 
MR. EKODA: The vocabulary, the sentence structure... even the
pronunciation! In those days, the H was pronounced with the
F sound. For example, the line "Hisakatano hikarino dokeki
haruno hini" would be... "Fisakatano fikarino dokeki..."
etc. Mmm... Exquisite, isn't it...?
increased.
[Main puts his head down.]
eyes... You start to feel better... Your condition is
now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? Tomorrow's the school trip, dude! I'm so psyched!
...It kinda sucks that we're only going to Kyoto, though.
KEN: Hm, Junpei-san seems to have his energy back. I guess there was no reason
to worry about him.
JUNPEI: Huh? What're ya talkin' about? I'm always energetic! By the way, you
better behave while we're gone. Don't go throwin' any parties, got it?
KEN: I won't. Oh, and please don't worry about bringing me back a souvenir.
JUNPEI: ...Hey, are ya tryin' to use reverse psychosis on me or somethin'?
KEN: No, of course not. ...It's just that Kyoto has a lot of great tasting
snacks.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

in Kyoto in the afternoon. You hope it will be a memorable experience...
[The train arrives at the Kyoto Station and the students get off.]
JUNPEI: Kyoto, huh? Talk about boring...
RYOJI: You don't like it? Personally, I think it's one of the most beautiful
places in the world!
JUNPEI: Whatever...
[Yukari looks back and smiles.]

=== EVENING ===

already set...
[The juniors reach the inn.]
JUNPEI: We're finally here! Whoa, nice place!
YUKARI: It IS an expensive area, after all.
[Ryoji spots a large umbrella nearby.]
RYOJI: Hey, what's that umbrella for?
MAIN: 
RYOJI: ...I see. So, that's the style here in Kyoto, huh? ...So, which
way to the geishas?
RYOJI: Huh? But this is the 1st floor! ...This building would have to
be pretty old. ...So, which way to the geishas?
RYOJI: ...Maybe it's for good luck. Speaking of which... Where can I
find a geisha?
JUNPEI: That's right, I forgot about that! Count me in!
YUKARI: Keep dreamin', Junpei.
[Everyone walks forward to a window, where they can see a small pool.]
AIGIS: The stone area outside is filled with water... Is this one of the
open-air hot springs I have heard about?
FUUKA: No, it's just a courtyard... It's not meant for bathing.
JUNPEI: So, where were you guys gonna go at your old school, Ryoji?
...Somewhere interesting, I bet. Kyoto's so typical, don't ya think?
RYOJI: Hmm... I don't really remember.
YUKARI: ...Are you serious? That's the highlight of the year!
[Ms. Toriumi walks over to them.]
MS. TORIUMI: Come on, you can talk later. You're blocking the hallway. Girls,
your rooms are that way. Why don't you go get unpacked?
[She leaves and some other girls walk off in the direction she indicated.]
JUNPEI: ...You heard her.
FUUKA: We'll see you later, then.
[Yukari and Fuuka begin to walk off, and Junpei tries to follow them.]
YUKARI: Hey, knock it off, Junpei. Back over there!
[He walks back.]
YUKARI: ...Aigis, get with the program.
[Aigis follows Yukari and Fuuka out of the lobby.]

=== DAYTIME ===

[A quick anime scene plays of snapshots of shrines the party visits.]
person was much more exciting than seeing them in photographs. In the
afternoon, everyone went their seperate ways at the Kamogawa near the hotel.
The river bank of the Kamogawa, near Sanjo Bridge, nighttime...
[Mitsuru is standing on the river bank. Yukari approaches her.]
YUKARI: We should probably head back. We don't want to miss curfew.
[Mitsuru gives her a quick glance. Yukari walks down to where Mitsuru is
standing.]
YUKARI: The later it gets, the more crowded the Shijou becomes.
MITSURU: Why are you still concerned about me? Our days of fighting together
are over. We have no common goal to fight for, no enemies to defeat...
no reason to be friends.
YUKARI: ...That's not true...
MITSURU: We've reached our conclusion... Why should we continue on? Everything
I believed in was a lie. And in the end, I failed to...
YUKARI: You failed to what? To protect the most important person in your life?
Is that what you're trying to say? You said you were atoning for what
the Kirijo Group did in the past, but that's not true. You were only
fighting to protect your father.
MITSURU: That's right! I fought to protect him, and look what happened! My
trust for the Chairman blinded me, and I fell right into his trap!
There was nothing I could do! My father placed the onus of
responsibility all upon himself. And ever since the incident, he
looked as if he was dead inside. I fought so that he could release the
shame and guilt that burdened him so!
YUKARI: ......
MITSURU: But my efforts were futile... and now my life is without meaning.
Right!?
[Yukari slaps her.]
YUKARI: I'm sorry. But, we don't know that for sure yet.
MITSURU: ......
YUKARI: Hey, did you know that I used to live around here? After my dad died,
my mom spent all her time throwing herself at random men... I couldn't
stand seeing her acting like that, so I used to come out here to the
river bank to get away.
MITSURU: ......
YUKARI: My belief in my dad was all I had...
MITSURU: Your father was only doing what he thought was best...
YUKARI: Yes, but it was still wrong. So he fought to the end to try and make it
right again. He never gave up. He believed Shadows were dangerous, and
they needed to be stopped, even if it meant losing his life... That's
why I fight. I want to eliminate the Dark Hour and fulfill my dad's
final wish.
MITSURU: Fulfill his final wish...
YUKARI: That's all I--no, we, can do. ...Right, Senpai?
MITSURU: Yes... Yes, I agree, Takeba. It's not over yet. Nothing had been
decided. We must put an end to this. For the sake of my father... and
yours.
YUKARI: Senpai...
MITSURU: Yukari, will you stand with me until the end?
[Yukari bows and then runs back up the bank.]
YUKARI: Well, I guess we should go and take a bath together now.
MITSURU: T-Take a bath together?
YUKARI: Yeah, in the outdoor hot spring back at the hotel. It's really nice.
Now that we have everything out in the open, there's nothing left for
us to hide!
MITSURU: ...Nothing?
YUKARI: H-Hey, stop blushing! I didn't mean it like that! Anyways, we should
really get going. It's already past curfew.
[Yukari runs off. Mitsuru looks up.]
MITSURU: There is no need to worry, Father... I am not alone. ...And I'll never
look back again.
[Penthesilea appears above Mitsuru and changes into another Persona.]
[Artemisia disappears.]
MITSURU: ...Please watch over me.

classmates, and Yukari. Something must have happened.

=== EVENING ===

[Main goes downstairs and talks to Junpei.]
JUNPEI: S'up, Main. Wanna check out the outdoor hot spring?
[Main agrees to go.]
JUNPEI: Yeah, dawg! I'll go get Akihiko-senpai and Ryoji, while you go back to
your room and get ready.
[Main goes back to his room. Later, the guys are in the hot springs.]
RYOJI: Did you know that this hot spring is open to guys at certain times and
girls at others?
JUNPEI: No way, really? Then, there's a chance it could change to girls only
while we're still bathing. But if that happens, there's nothing we can
do about it. I mean, we're already here, right?
RYOJI: That's true. We couldn't be blamed if something like that were to
happen. Don't you agree?
MAIN: 
RYOJI: Well, it's really just a hypothetical question.
JUNPEI: ...Hey, isn't it getting kinda hot in here?
AKIHIKO: So, Junpei, at what time does this hot-spring change from guys only
to girls only?
JUNPEI: Uh, I'm not sure. I didn't bother to check. ...Right, Ryoji-kun?
RYOJI: Right. But it could happen at any moment, couldn't it, Junpei-kun?
AKIHIKO: So that's why we came at this strange time? ...You two are such
idiots!
JUNPEI: Calm down, man. We're just joking! Although you're right about
it being a weird time to be here. But, don't worry. It's pretty late.
I doubt any girls would--
[They suddenly hear the sound of moving water.]
JUNPEI: ...Shit! Someone's here! What're we gonna do...?
AKIHIKO: ...It's probably just a guy.
RYOJI: Don't worry. This is simply a misunderstanding. We'll just act like we
didn't know.
YUKARI: Wow! This hot spring is huge!
FUUKA: Oh, you're right... It's the size of a swimming pool.
AIGIS: So, this is an outdoor hotspring. Unfortunately, its
therapeutic healing benefits will not help me.
JUNPEI: Dammit, it's them... What're they doing here this late...?
RYOJI: Yes! Both Yukari-san AND Fuuka-san! This is my lucky ni--ngh!
[Ryoji stands up to get a look and Junpei pulls him down, dunking his head
under the water.]
JUNPEI: Shut up, you idiot! They'll hear you.
[Junpei lets him up.]
YUKARI: ...Who's that!? Is someone there!?
MITSUU: ...What's the matter, Yukari? Did you hear something?
AKIHIKO: M-Mitsuru's here, too!? Oh, man. There's no way she'll consider this
just a "misunderstanding"!
JUNPEI: Yeah, but it's not like we could get expelled for this, right? I mean,
it was men only when we got here. So, it's actually kinda funny, if
you think about it.
AKIHIKO: This is Mitsuru we're talking about. If she finds us, she'll...
JUNPEI: What? She'll what?
AKIHIKO: She'll execute us...!
RYOJI: E-Execute us!?
YUKARI: ...Yeah, I think I heard something. Fuuka, could you check
over there? I-It could be a ghost...
FUUKA: Um... but... I, uh... Okay...
[The hot springs minigame begins.]
FUUKA: I'm scared to look around by myself... Yukari-chan, will you look with
me?
YUKARI: Okay, fine... Let's start on the right side.
HELP: TRY NOT TO GET CAUGHT BY THE GIRLS! IF YOU DO, THEY WON'T LET YOU OFF THE
HOOK VERY EASILY! NOW, RUN AND HIDE!
[The guys are standing in front of the girls.]
JUNPEI: Uh, we, uh, um...
AKIHIKO: W-Wait! Th-This is just a misunderstanding...!
MITSURU: Silence! I'm going to execute you all!
AIGIS: It was nice knowing you.
[Yukari walks back to the other girls.]
YUKARI: ...There's nothing there. Sorry, it must have been my
imagination...
FUUKA: Doesn't the water seem a little hot? I'm beginning to feel
faint...
MITSURU: It appears that Yamagishi's ability is ineffective
when she's without clothing...
FUUKA: W-Well, of course it is!
AIGIS: To be honest, I am rather surprised by the difference between
human bodies. More specifically...
YUKARI: Okay, that's enough, Aigis. Let's go. I'l treat you to some
ice cream.
AIGIS: Ice cream would be quite useful. I require some cooling down.
[The girls leave.]
AKIHIKO: ...Okay, they're gone. Whew, that was close... We never
would've survived Mitsuru's "execution." ...Huh?
[The camera pans back to the guys. Junpei and Ryoji have become so
steamed that their skin has turned red and they're floating in the
water unconsciously.]
AKIHIKO: ...Looks like they passed out. Well, I guess that's what they
deserve...

=== DAYTIME ===

afternoon. You are free until then.
[The guys are sitting in the inn lobby. Ms. Toriumi walks by.]
MS. TORIUMI: Everyone remembers what time we're meeting at Kyoto Station, yes?
Then, please be on time. If any of you are late, I'm the one who
will be blamed.
[She walks off.]
JUNPEI: I'll never forget Kyoto... How could I after last night...?
AKIHIKO: ......
RYOJI: That truly was an "execution"...
AKIHIKO: ...Just try to forget about it.
[Yukari, Fuuka, and Aigis walk by. They stop to look at the guys.]
YUKARI: ......
FUUKA: ......
[The girls walk away.]
JUNPEI: Looks like they're still pissed...
[Mitsuru walks by without stopping.]
JUNPEI: I thought Kyoto was gonna blow, but it really wasn't that
bad... I guess it's mostly because of last night.
AKIHIKO: ......
RYOJI: You know, in the hot spring...
AKIHIKO: Shhh! Yeah, I know. Now, keep your voice down...
[Yukari, Fuuka, and Aigis walk by. They stop to look at the guys.]
FUUKA: Hm? What's going on, guys?
JUNPEI: U-Um, we're just having a, um... a reflection meeting.
YUKARI: ...Oh yeah? What're you reflecting on?
JUNPEI: Huh? O-Oh, nothing...
FUUKA: Okay...
YUKARI: Whatever...
[The girls walk away.]
JUNPEI: This is our secret... You guys better take it to the grave.

=== EVENING ===

KEN: ...Hello! Wow, that was fast... How was Kyoto?
JUNPEI: Aw, man... I'm so tired. ...But, it was a lotta fun. I brought you back
some "souvenir stories," so I'll tell ya them later.
KEN: ...Oh, okay. I can't wait to hear them...
JUNPEI: We can't go to Tartarus tonight; we're all too tired. Let's go tomorrow
night... even though we don't have anything to fight for anymore...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of boys are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: After the day off on Monday, we've got Career
Experience starting on Tuesday... Where have they got you
working?
LISTENING STUDENT: Tuesday and Wednesday, I've got a construction job. And on
Thurday and Friday, I'm at a gas station...
GOSSIPING STUDENT: That's just as bad as mine... I'll be picking up empty cans.
[Main and the boys enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Ms. Toriumi is teaching Composition.]
MS. TORIUMI: So, did everyone enjoy the school trip? I didn't. I couldn't care
less about shrines and temples... Career Week starts next
Tuesday. Just think of it as another boring field trip, for
social studies. Going out into the real world is pretty tough.
By the end of the week, you'll understand. Myself, I'm glad for
the chance to relax... Anyway, today, we'll go through some famous
pieces that are set in Kyoto.
MAIN: 
MS. TORIUMI: ...The stone pagoda on this page is the Adashi no Nenbutsu
Temple. I'm not crazy about stone temples like this, but
I take it that some of you went there.

[Main puts his head down.]
eyes... You start to feel better... Your condition is
now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===

FUUKA: ...Hi, how was your day? ...Ryoji-kun was just here. He came to hang out
with Junpei-kun. It's not often that we get visitors here.
YUKARI: Yeah... Do you think it's okay? I'm actually surprised that he's not
with a girl. ...Hey, where's Aigis?
KEN: I saw her on the 2nd floor.
YUKARI: Really...? Hmm... Maybe she's with Koromaru... It's not like them to
be gone.

=== LATE NIGHT ===

[Chidori is in her hospital room with her sketchbook.]
CHIDORI: What am I drawing...?
[The lights go out.]
CHIDORI: What the...?
[She hears the sound of breaking glass, and the alarm goes off. The door to her
room open.]
TAKAYA: It has been a while...
CHIDORI: That voice...
[Takaya and Jin enter the room.]
TAKAYA: I am glad to see you once again... Jin, the instruments, if you would.
[Jin walks over to the bed, opens his suitcase, and puts some tools on the
bed.]
TAKAYA: I trust you do not need to be restrained?
CHIDORI: Takaya...
TAKAYA: Surely you understand... There is nowhere for you to go... You must
come with us. Death is not to be feared. You need only fear--
CHIDORI: Yes, I know.
TAKAYA: ...Excellent.
[Takaya and Jin leave the room. After a couple minutes, Chidori is back in
her old costume.]
CHIDORI: It's all his fault... Since the day I met him, I've experienced
nothing but pain... And I've become afraid of dying...
JIN: Hey, hurry up, Chidori.
[She walks out, leaving her sketchbook on the bed.]

=== EVENING ===


=== DARK HOUR ===

[Main is asleep in his room.]
FUUKA: I'm sorry to wake you up... Um, I'm not sure how to
say this, but... You need to go to the 4th floor... and please hurry!
[Fuuka is in the meeting room with Juno summoned. Mitsuru and Akihiko are
already there. The other party members arrive.]
YUKARI: What's going on!?
MITSURU: Yamagishi sensed something! ...Other Persona-users. They're outside
Tartarus!
KEN: Other Persona-users...? Don't tell me it's...
AKIHIKO: ...Strega. They're still alive.
YUKARI: First, the Dark Hour won't go away, and now Strega is back!? What's
happening!?
AKIHIKO: How many are there, Yamagishi?
FUUKA: There's only one, but... I thought she was in the
hospital...
[There's a flash. Fuuka holds her hands to her head.]
FUUKA: No... she's... she's inside...
MITSURU: What's wrong!?
CHIDORI: ...Long time no see.
JUNPEI: Chidori!?
MITSURU: She's speaking through Yamagishi!?
CHIDORI: I can't stand the sight of you all anymore... So,
I've decided to do something about it. Come to me...
[Fuuka seems to regain control.]
YUKARI: What the heck...!? I thought she was... Junpei, do you know what's
going on!? Junpei!
JUNPEI: No, dammit! I have no idea! Just leave me the hell alone!
[He runs out of the room.]
YUKARI: J-Junpei? Junpei, wait!
MITSURU: This is most likely a trap. But, we're dealing with Strega, so we
must pursue this. ...And if we confront them, we may gain some insight
into our current situation.
FUUKA: Please be careful. I sensed one person, but the other
two may be nearby.
MITSURU: We have no idea what they're planning, so choose your allies wisely.
We'll go after Iori once you've made your decision.
[Main selects a party. Later, Junpei and Chidori are outside Tartarus.]
JUNPEI: Chidori! What's going on!? Why are you doing this!?
CHIDORI: ......
JUNPEI: It doesn't make any sense! I mean, I know I'm not that smart, and I've
done a lot of stupid stuff... But, we shouldn't be fighting like this!
[She starts to approch her.]
FUUKA: Junpei-kun! Look out!
[Chidori swings her weapon at him but Junpei manages to dodge in time.]
JUNPEI: Whoa...!
CHIDORI: Tch...
[The other party members run up to the scene.]
JUNPEI: Chidori...! Why!?
AKIHIKO: Get back, Junpei! It's useless trying to reason with her!
FUUKA: No! It's too dangerous! ...I know how you feel, Junpei-kun! But please,
just back up!
[The party begins battle with Chidori.]
CHIDORI: I don't belong here... I... I've always known that!
[Chidori takes some damage.]
CHIDORI: Takaya was right... You're a nuisance!
[Chidori reaches critical condition.]
CHIDORI: Why!? Why won't you leave me alone!? I just don't get it, Junpei...
[The party defeats Chidori. She drops to her knees and Junpei runs over to
her.]
JUNPEI: Chidori!
CHIDORI: I told you... Don't touch me...
JUNPEI: Chidori, please... Tell me why you're doing this...
CHIDORI: What I fear most isn't death. What I fear most is... attachment. Once
I become attacked to something, I fear that I will lose it. That's
why we only live for the moment... But you... you brought me pain...
Pain that I didn't want... Pain that I never asked for...
JUNPEI: Huh...?
CHIDORI: When I'm with you, Junpei, I fear everything... I fear loss... I fear
death... I fear that my time with you will end... That's why I...
JUNPEI: Chidori...?
FUUKA: I'm sensing...
MITSURU: What? What is it?
[Takaya and Jin suddenly appear in front of the doors to Tartarus.]
KEN: So then...
AKIHIKO: There you are, you sons of bitches!
TAKAYA: Chidori... I see that it is too late. You've been poisoned by
them...
JUNPEI: What the hell does that mean, you figgin' ghost!?
TAKAYA: I am no ghost... Fate permitted me to live, even though I
wasn't attached to life... You might say I was... chosen.
JUNPEI: You bastard... I've made up my mind! I won't let you do this to her
anymore! I'll protect Chidori with my life! Chidori, don't stay with
them! Come with me!
[Takaya pulls out his revolver.]
TAKAYA: 
AKIHIKO: Look out, Junpei!!
[Junpei stands up and Takaya shoots him.]
JUNPEI: Huh...?
[Junpei puts a hand to his chest before dropping to the ground. Chidori turns
to look at him.]
CHIDORI: Jun...pei...
FUUKA: Nooooooooo!!
[The scene fades out and changes into another scene. Junpei is lying in a
hospital bed and Chidori is sitting in a chair next to him.]
JUNPEI: ...!?
CHIDORI: I'm so happy you're awake...
[Junpei sits up.]
JUNPEI: Chidori...? Huh...? I-I thought I was...
[Chidori takes his hand.]
CHIDORI: I... I was wrong... I was scared... and I blamed you for my heartache.
I never felt that way before I met you, Junpei... And for the first
time in my life, I... I realized what I wanted...
JUNPEI: And, what is that?
CHIDORI: I... I want to be with you, Junpei. Forever.
JUNPEI: I, um, I... I want to be with you, too...
CHIDORI: But, it could never last... I'm different from you... Since the
moment I gained my power, I've known the day I was going to die.
JUNPEI: What...!?
CHIDORI: Knowing that scared me... because I had never really thought about
dying... And it made me realize that I wouldn't be with you anymore...
[She takes his other hand.]
JUNPEI: Chidori...
CHIDORI: That's why this is how it should be... You can't die here, Junpei.
JUNPEI: Die...?
[There's a flash.]
JUNPEI: Huh!?
[The vision fades back to reality. Chidori uses Medea on Junpei.]
JUNPEI: ...Ah!
FUUKA: Junpei-kun!
YUKARI: Junpei!
JUNPEI: I...
CHIDORI: It worked...
AKIHIKO: She revived him... I can't believe it.
FUUKA: Her power is the opposite of mine. Her Persona doesn't sense life; it
emits life... But, in order to revive a person, she must...
[Chidori suddenly falls into Junpei's lap.]
JUNPEI: Chidori!
CHIDORI: I can hear the life pulsing through you...
JUNPEI: Huh...?
CHIDORI: Now I will live inside you, and we'll be together... forever.
JUNPEI: Wh-What're you saying...!? Chidori... Chidori!
CHIDORI: I'll protect you, Junpei... always...
JUNPEI: I-I'll protect you too! Please... don't go!
[She holds her hand up and Junpei takes it.]
CHIDORI: It feels so nice to be with you...
JUNPEI: Chidori...!
CHIDORI: Thank you... Jun...pei... I love you...
[Her hand goes limp and drops to the floor.]
JUNPEI: ...!? This can't be happening... Chidori... Chidori, answer me...
Chidori...! Aaaaaaaah!!
TAKAYA: What a pity... Such a meaningless death...
JUNPEI: Meaningless...!?
[Junpei sets Chidori on the ground and turns around.]
TAKAYA: Hm?
JUNPEI: Aaaah...!
[Junpei uses his Evoker and summones Hermes.]
JIN: ...!?
[Hermes changes into another Persona.]
TAKAYA: What!?
JUNPEI: Aaaaaaaaaargggggh!!
[Jin runs forward and gets hit with a blast of fire, knocking him back.]
JIN: Gah!
JUNPEI: I refuse to... ugh...
[Junpei drops to his knees. The rest of the party runs forward.]
AKIHIKO: Junpei!
TAKAYA: My... That was quite a specticle. Now, allow me to reciprocate.
[Takaya pulls out his revoler, but Jin grabs his other arm.]
JIN: Takaya, don't!
TAKAYA: ...Wh-What is the meaning of this!?  Release me!
JIN: Don't forget about your mission! This is just a waste of energy!
TAKAYA: I have something much greater to accomplish... And since
you have no means of destroying the Dark Hour, I will let you be...
for now.
[Takaya makes a gesture with his revolver.]
TAKAYA: ...But know that the day I shall finish this is soon approaching.
[Jin throws out a smoke bomb and they escape.]
JUNPEI: Wait!
AKIHIKO: Stop!
JUNPEI: Let go! I...!
AKIHIKO: She entrusted you with this life! Don't waste it.
JUNPEI: ......
[Junpei turns back around to face Chidori.]
JUNPEI: Chidori... Chidori, I... I... This is so hard... But... It's not just
my life anymore...
YUKARI: Junpei...
[The scene fades out.]
can find the right words to say to Junpei... ......

=== EARLY MORNING ===


=== EVENING ===

KEN: ...Hello! ...Junpei-san's still in his room... It's hard to lose someone
you're close to... ...... I'm worried about him...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

the cardboard boxes...

=== EVENING ===

KEN: ...Hello! Junpei-san's still not feeling well... I'm getting really
worried now...
YUKARI: After all he's been through... I can understand why he's feeling
down... He got really lucky this week, though... No one realized he
took some days off because everyone was at Career Experience. Well,
I hope he's feeling a little better now...
KEN: ...I'm going to defeat those Strega guys. I can't take this anymore...!
YUKARI: ...I know how you feel. But, you don't have to do it all by yourself.
KEN: ...I know.

=== EVENING ===

[The party members are gathered around the table in the dorm lounge. Junpei
walks in.]
AKIHIKO: Cheer up, Junpei...
JUNPEI: Yeah... So, whaddya want?
[Mitsuru slides a sketchbook over to him.]
MITSURU: This came for you. It's from the hospital.
JUNPEI: That's...
MITSURU: They were going through her items when they found that.
JUNPEI: I know I have to snap out of this, but it's just so hard...
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Hey, Junpei, can I take a look?
JUNPEI: You wouldn't be able to understand her drawings anyway...
[Yukari opens the cover to reveal the top picture.]
YUKARI: Wait, is this...?
FUUKA: Wow, it's really good...
YUKARI: This is amazing... Who wouldn't be able to understand it?
[Junpei turns to take a closer look at the picture.]
JUNPEI: Huh? Is this...!?
AIGIS: ...It's a detailed portrait of Junpei-san.
[Junpei drops to his knees and puts his head down on the picture.]
JUNPEI: Chidori...
AKIHIKO: Junpei...
[Ken and Koromaru walk over.]
KOROMARU: 
[Junpei stands back up.]
JUNPEI: It's like she's telling me to stop moping around...
FUUKA: She must be looking out for you...
KOROMARU: Arf!
[Junpei turns to Main and puts his hand out.]
JUNPEI: I promise to fight to get rid of the Dark Hour. And, I'm sorry for all
the times I snapped at you... It still bothers me a little... But, I
want you to know that I'm counting on your abilities.
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Always joking around, huh?
[Main takes Junpei's hand and shakes it.]
YUKARI: Junpei...
AIGIS: ......
[Fool Arcana to rank 9.]

=== EVENING ===

YUKARI: ...Oh, hey. The full moon's almost here. No Shadows have appeared yet,
but I'm still worried. ...Oh, that reminds me... Ryoji-kun's here
again. He's visiting Junpei. Junpei's still pretty down... so I'm
glad he has a good friend like Ryoji-kun.

=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Ekoda is teaching Classic Literature.]
MR. EKODA: Oh, how sublimely the heroine Murasakino-ue is portrayed in this
passage! She was written to be the ideal woman of the Heian
period... The quintessetinal Heian beauty. Speaking of Heian
beauty... Here's a question for you, Main.
[Main stands up.]
MR EKODA: In both past and present, fair-skinned women are considered
beautiful, but... Women of the Heian period would put white makeup
on their faces. Do you know the reason why?
MAIN: 
MR. EKODA: Hmph... Wrong. See how much we lose, as civilization
"advances"... It was difficult to see people's faces at
night, when all they had were candles. It was very important
to women that their faces be visible in the dark. Now, the
kanji character for "beauty"...
MR. EKODA: Hmph... I suppose it was an easy question. It was difficult
to see people's faces at night, when all they had were
candles. It was very important to women that their faces be
visible in the dark. Now, the kanji character for
"beauty"...

=== EVENING ===

[Ryoji and the party members are in the dorm lounge.]
JUNPEI: See ya later, Ryoji! And hey, stop freaking out about your exams. I
didn't study either.
YUKARI: But then again, you never do...
[Main enters the dorm and walks over.]
RYOJI: Oh, hi. What's up? Studying? You know, I'm here a lot, but I hardly ever
run into you. Strange, huh? Oh well, I'm outta here. See ya later.
[Ryoji leaves the dorm. Aigis walks over to the group.]
AIGIS: ...Was that Ryoji-san?
YUKARI: Yeah, he said he was going home.
AIGIS: What was he doing here?
YUKARI: He's been coming here a lot, ever since he started hanging around with
Junpei.
AIGIS: But, visitors aren't allowed here...
JUNPEI: Yeah, but Mitsuru-senpai said that it's okay during the day.
FUUKA: I don't think we need to worry about Ryoji-kun.
AIGIS: He's... dangerous...
FUUKA: Who? Ryoji-kun?
YUKARI: Come to think of it, he WAS hitting on Mitsuru-senpai the first time he
met her.
AKIHIKO: He was...?
FUUKA: ...But, having him around has really cheered up Junpei-kun.
JUNPEI: Well, it's not like moping around's gonna bring her back...
AIGIS: That's true... I envy you, Junpei... I'm a machine, so I cannot
understand how it feels to "live".
JUNPEI: ...But, you don't seem that different.
AIGIS: However, it is more accurate to say that I am "functioning" as opposed
to living. There are times when I malfunction, but I can always be
repaired...
JUNPEI: So if we were all like you... we wouldn't have to worry about dying...
Uh, sorry... Hey, I don't have time to talk. I seriously gotta go
study... Hey, shouldn't you guys be studying too? I heard math's gonna
be a killer.
YUKARI: ...You wait until NOW to tell us that!? Well, I guess we should call it
a night then...
[Most of the party members walk off. Main starts to leave too, but stops when
Aigis starts talking.]
AIGIS: I should not possess the gift of "life"... A "living" weapon is
difficult to operate... However, I believe I understand the concept of
loss... Should you ever be harmed, I...
MAIN: 
AIGIS: ...I'll try not to.
AIGIS: I'm sorry. I'm just... concerned.
AIGIS: You are very special to me... I do not know why, but I always want to be
by your side... I want to protect you... I apologize for interrupting
you... I will leave you to your studies. ...Good night.
[Aigis walks over towards the stairs.]
AIGIS: Ryoji Mochizuki is dangerous... What is this uneasiness...? I am a
machine... I cannot die, so they won't have to grieve for me. I must
do something... I don't want them to suffer anymore...

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? Tomorrow's the full moon... But, we don't have any
Shadows to kill. Man, this sucks... I heard Ryoji's not feeling good.
Maybe he's been studying too much... Haha! Nah, that can't be it.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Aigis there.]
AIGIS: Good morning. ...I intend to do my best to protect everyone.
MAIN: 
AIGIS: No, please do not worry. I just wanted to share my feelings.
AIGIS: ...Understood.
[Main and Aigis enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

FUUKA: ...Hi, how was your day? Tonight is the full moon... but we won't be
conducting an operation. Maybe I should summon Juno, though, just in
case... By the way, have you seen Aigis?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: Aigis has been returning late these days. She never used to... I wonder
what happened.

=== DARK HOUR ===

[Ryoji is standing on the Moonlight Bridge looking at the moon. Aigis comes up
behind him.]
AIGIS: I've been looking for you.
RYOJI: You... You're...
AIGIS: What are you doing here?
RYOJI: ...Oh, that's right. You don't really like me, do you? Well, to answer
your question, I ended up here when I came to my senses. It's strange...
The sky and the ground look so weird, and there's no one here...
Something terrible has happened here, and yet I feel at peace.
AIGIS: ...Have you forgotten?
RYOJI: Forgotten what?
AIGIS: The Dark Hour--a time period few people are active during. But you,
you've somehow adapted to it... Too well for a human, in fact.
RYOJI: ......
AIGIS: Yes... It's all so clear. Now I understand the reason behind this
feeling I sense when you're around. You are not good. You are...
my enemy.
RYOJI: Your enemy...?
[Ryoji pauses to think for a second.]
RYOJI: That's right... On a night like tonight... the moon was full... It was
long ago...
AIGIS: Yes... We met once before... as adversaries.
RYOJI: Who... Who am I? Who are you...?
AIGIS: I am Aigis. The last remaining Anti-Shadow Emergency Control Weapon.
A machine created to destroy Shadows.
RYOJI: Created to... destroy Shadows...
AIGIS: And you... your true name is "Death"... You are the Shadow I sealed away
ten years ago!
[She moves into a battle stance.]
RYOJI: !?
[Aigis leaps forward towards Ryoji.]
RYOJI: Yes... Ten years ago, the night I was born into this world... I set foot
on this very bridge.
[A flashback starts as Aigis and Ryoji converse.]
AIGIS: The sole purpose of my existance is to destroy Shadows. For that reason
I was given a personality... and a Persona.
[The past version of Aigis is standing on the Moonlight Bridge.]
RYOJI: They said I was Death, the 13th Arcana that was never meant to be...
and I wasn't in this world for long before parts of my body escaped me,
leaving me incomplete... as I was when I met you.
[The Death Shadow is floating next to a crashed car. The past Aigis begins
attacking it.]
AIGIS: Even so, your strength was far greater than I anticipated. The only
possible alternative was to seal you away... And as circumstance would
have it, a suitable vessel was available: a human child standing
nearby...
[A younger version of Main is next to the crashed car.]
AIGIS: ...So I did what was necessary.
RYOJI: I see, so I was confined within him, and I lead him to my twelve missing
pieces without realizing it. And then... I remember! I remember
everything! It all makes sense now... Who, and what, I am.
[The flashback ends and Aigis is standing in front of Ryoji.]
AIGIS: Palladion!
[Aigis summons her Persona and tries to attack Ryoji.]
RYOJI: Stop, don't be foolish, Aigis. There's no way you can win. I'm different
than before.
AIGIS: A machine is created for a purpose. Mine is to defeat you. I exist for
nothing else.
RYOJI: It doesn't have to be that way...
[Aigis uses her Persona against Ryoji, but after a few seconds she falters and
her Persona disappears.]
AIGIS: I am sorry... I have failed. A machine is worthless if it cannot fulfill
its purpose.
[She looks back up at Ryoji, and a series of images flash by: Ryoji, a young
Main, and the Shadow called Death.]
AIGIS: I'm sorry... I'm... afraid.
[Meanwhile, Mitsuru and Fuuka are in the meeting room. Fuuka has Juno summoned.
Yukari enters.]
YUKARI: Hey... Don't scare me like that.
MITSURU: Is something wrong?
YUKARI: Well, it's a full moon tonight... You noticed it too, didn't you,
Senpai? Geez, I'm starting to feel like a workaholic! Oh no... Did
something...?
MITSURU: We don't know anything for sure... However, we can't find Aigis.
YUKARI: Huh? Where would she have gone?
FUUKA: I sensed a Persona, but it quickly disappeared. And
soon after that, I couldn't detect Aigis's presence.
YUKARI: Could it have been Strega...?
MITSURU: Well, she hasn't sensed any of their members, but we can't be
positive.
FUUKA: I've confirmed Aigis's location. She's on the Moonlight
Bridge!
MITSURU: Alright, call the others. Let's see what's going on there.
[Koromaru arrives at the bridge and runs over to Aigis, who is obviously
damaged.]
KOROMARU: 
YUKARI: Aigis!?
[The rest of the party runs in.]
AIGIS: I'm sorry... I... I... remember everything... Who I am... Who "he" is...
[Aigis points toward Main, and he crouches down next to her and takes her
hand.]
AIGIS: I know why I wanted to be by your side... I'm sorry... I failed...
MAIN: 
AIGIS: I'm... sorry...
AIGIS: I'm... sorry...
FAMILIAR VOICE: There's no need for you to apologize...
[Ryoji walks over to the group.]
JUNPEI: You...!?
YUKARI: Ryoji-kun...? Wait, what're you doing here!?
[Aigis's hand drops.]
FUUKA: Aigis!
AKIHIKO: What's going on...?
RYOJI: It's all my fault...
[Akihiko steps forward.]
MITSURU: Akihiko, wait. He's not showing any signs of aggression. Tell us...
Who are you? ...WHAT are you?
RYOJI: I'm the same as the beings you call Shadows.
JUNPEI: You're a Shadow!?
RYOJI: I'm the embodiment of all Shadows... The Appriser, born from the union
of the 12 Arcana.
YUKARI: The Appriser...?
RYOJI: I remember everything now... The frightening truth about myself... and
Shadows... It's all so hard to believe...
[He drops to his knees.]
MITSURU: ...You know the "truth" about Shadows?
RYOJI: Yes. Shadows are here to facilitate the rebirth of the maternal being.
She will begin to awaken as she is drawn to me... The Appriser.
MITSURU: You? You're The Appriser?
[Ryoji nods.]
FUUKA: What is this "maternal being"...?
RYOJI: She is a great entity... There is no comparable word in your language
for her. Ten years ago, a man collected a great number of Shadows and
contained them in a laboratory... That's where I was born. ...But the
unification was interrupted, and I awoke in an incomplete state. Not
long after, I fell to Aigis... as she did to me.
JUNPEI: Aigis...!? Is that true!? ...Ryoji?
RYOJI: She knew she could not defeat me... So in an act of desperation, she
sealed me within a child who happened to be standing nearby. That child
grew up, carrying me inside him. And by a twist of fate, he later
returned here... as a transfer student.
YUKARI: You mean...
RYOJI: Yes... I lived inside him. His special Persona awakened... as did the
12 Shadows, all in order to become one with me.
JUNPEI: Ryoji, you're The Appriser? A-And you were inside HIM!? None of this
makes sense!
RYOJI: It's all my fault... I'm sorry. There's more I need... to tell you...
[He passes out on the ground.]
FUUKA: Ryoji-kun!
MITSURU: He appears to be exhausted... Let's let him rest... We have Aigis to
attend to as well. We'll continue our talk later.
[The scene fades out.]
for ten years, waiting to make contact with the 12 Shadows... And the boy
named Pharos was actually Ryoji... ...... So many questions remain
unanswered. However, Ryoji is unconscious... So you have no choice but to
return to the dorm and rest...

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Main and Junpei are sitting in their homeroom. Mitsuru enters and walks over.]
MITSURU: ...He's awake now. Let's meet tonight on the 4th floor.
JUNPEI: ...Okay.
MITSURU: Alright, then. I'll see you later.
[She leaves.]
JUNPEI: Damn that Ryoji...

=== EVENING ===

[Ryoji and the party members are in the meeting room.]
MITSURU: Is everyone present?
FUUKA: Are you okay, Ryoji-kun?
RYOJI: Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks. Besides, there's more I have to tell you guys.
YUKARI: Ryoji-kun...
MITSURU: Yes, there are many questions we need answered. To begin with, you
said Shadows were here to faciliate the rebirth of the maternal
being... Please elaborate on this.
RYOJI: The maternal being is called Nyx.
JUNPEI: Who the hell's Nyx...?
RYOJI: Nyx is the mother of Shadows. In ancient times, she bestowed "Death" to
this world. If she is awakened, darkness will once again cover the land,
and all life will vanish.
AKIHIKO: You mean, everyone will die!?
MITSURU: All life will vanish...? Th-Then, that must mean...!
become like The Lost... leading to the extinxtion of mankind, and the end of
the world.
MITSURU: The Fall...
YUKARI: But, it's still possible to keep it from happening, right?
RYOJI: ......
YUKARI: Wh-What...? There's no way to prevent it...?
RYOJI: ...I'm sorry...
YUKARI: Wait, what're you apologizing for!? Are you saying it's for certain!?
RYOJI: Yes... You heard the bell... I'm The Appriser... The Appriser of
Death... My existence is the affirmation of the Fall.
will become members of The Lost. Ryoji's existance confirms the impending
extinction of mankind. ......
AKIHIKO: When!? When will it happen!?
RYOJI: I'm afraid you will not live to see spring...
JUNPEI: But, that's not too far away!
[Junpei looks around, but no one says anything.]
JUNPEI: Wh-What're you guys freaking out about? All we have to do is
defeat this Nyx! And that won't be a problem cuz we've never lost!
RYOJI: Defeating Nyx is... impossible. It has nothing to do with strength,
ability, or power. Just as all living things die... and the flow of time
is continuous... Nyx cannot be defeated.
JUNPEI: What...? That's bullshit!
KEN: This is all so sudden...
RYOJI: I was born from a collection of Shadows. But now, I have a human form...
So I can talk with you, laugh with you, cry with you... All gifts I
received because I was inside him. So... I can give you a choice.
YUKARI: A choice...?
RYOJI: Nyx's coming cannot be avoided. But, it is possible to live in peace
until she arrives. You'll have to... kill me. If I were to disappear,
all memories of the Dark Hour would disappear with me, as would any
recollection of the fate that awaits you. You won't remember anything.
The coming of the Fall will be instantaneous... and you will not suffer.
MITSURU: We'll forget everything?
RYOJI: You'll be able to return to your normal lives. And in doing so, the time
until the Fall will be slightly delayed. In essence, I am the same as
Nyx and cannot be killed. But thanks to him, there's a part of me that's
"human". So, if death comes from his hands, I think it may be possible.
FUUKA: Ryoji-kun...
RYOJI: If you don't kill me, you will suffer more than you could ever imagine.
With no hope for salvation, you will live every day paralyzed by the
fear of your impending death. And I... I don't want you to have to
endure such pain.
YUKARI: ...I don't want my memories to be erased. ...To forget everything would
be like hiding from the truth!
RYOJI: Would that really be such a bad thing? All that awaits you now is
despair. You don't know the terror of absolute death...! Please, don't
make your decision without at least thinking about what I've said.
YUKARI: ......
KEN: Why is this happening!?
RYOJI: You don't have to decide right now. You have until December 31st, New
Year's Eve, to think about it. After that, I'll dissolve into the
blackness of the Dark Hour and become intangible.
JUNPEI: Ryoji...?
RYOJI: I will disappear with the coming of Nyx anyways... So, don't worry about
me. I'll be back on New Year's Eve...
[Ryoji takes one last look around before leaving the room.]
JUNPEI: H-Hey, Ryoji, wait!
[The door closes. Junpei starts to go after him.]
FUUKA: Wait! I can't sense him anymore. Ryoji-kun's no longer here...
AKIHIKO: Are you sure?
FUUKA: Yes...
KEN: ......
YUKARI: Ryoji-kun...
MITSURU: We will see him again, on New Year's Eve.
[The scene fades out.]
of mankind is extinction... A difficult decision lies before you... Death is
inevitable... The Appriser waits for you. ...... You cannot think clearly.
How does a person choose the way he will die?

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: I heard some people saying that Apathy Syndrome is nothing
to worry about.
LISTENING STUDENT: I heard the same thing. It puts people at ease, right?
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Yeah... It certainly does for me. You think it's some new
religion?
LISTENING STUDENT: What, are you taking this seriously?
GOSSIPING STUDENT: O-Of course not!
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...... Oh, you're back... My bad. Could last night just have been a
dream or something...? ...... No, probably not, huh...?

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Did you hear about Ryoji in Class 2-F?
LISTENING STUDENT: No, I didn't! What happened to him?
GOSSIPING STUDENT: His parents got transferred again, so he won't be around
anymore.
LISTENING STUDENT: So that's why I didn't see him... I wasn't expecting that!
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

MITSURU: ...? Oh, it's you. ... ...... Never mind. There's no point
in asking someone else...
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Sorry... Please forget I even said anything.
MITSURU: No, I'm not really scared. I just can't seem to comprehend all
that has happened. I thought I would grow stronger after my
father died, but I haven't...

=== EVENING ===

AKIHIKO: ...... Oh, it's you. Sorry, I was just daydreaming. I was thinking
about what Shinji would say if I met him in Heaven.
MAIN: 
AKIHIKO: He probably won't say anything... He'll just punch me in the
face. He's got a strong right hook, so I'm sure it's gonna
hurt.
AKIHIKO: No, not really... It takes a long time for me to register
fear... But, even though I've experienced losing someone
before, that always hurts...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Yukari there.]
YUKARI: Mornin'... Things have been pretty crazy lately, huh... No one's in the
mood to talk, either.
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Right... I suppose that's best.
YUKARI: Yeah, I know how you feel... But, we have to cheer up sooner
or later...
[Main and Yukari enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Ms. Ounishi is teaching Chemistry.]
MS. OUNISHI: It's already December... The year's almost over! But that doesn't
mean you can slack off! That's right! Exams start next Monday!
Though... didn't we just have them not too long ago? Anyway, take
notes, because I'm about to tell you what'll be on the chemistry
exam.
MAIN: 
MS. OUNISHI: Make sure you study the graph of reversible reactions over
time. Next...  Oof, I'm tired. We're wrapping up
the development of a new medicine right now. I'm not gonna
lose to Mr. Edogawa...
increased.
[Main puts his head down.]
eyes... You start to feel better... Your condition is
now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===

FUUKA: ...Hi, how was your day? ...... U-Um... Try to cheer up.
MAIN: 
FUUKA: O-Oh, okay then. U-Um... Sorry, Main-kun, I know you're
strong...
FUUKA: Oh, you're welcome... ...... Sorry, I guess I'm the one who's
the most confused...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Fuuka there.]
FUUKA: Good morning... So, Main-kun, have you decided what you're going to
do...?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: I'm scared...
FUUKA: You're so brave, Main-kun. But, I'm scared...
FUUKA: Even Ken-kun is down... What are we going to do...?
[Main and Fuuka enter the school.]

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Akihiko there.]
AKIHIKO: Hey, Main... Don't you think it's funny...? We have so much to worry
about, but we're still going to school as if nothing's changed...
MAIN: 
AKIHIKO: But, we'll have to make up our minds sooner or later.
Otherwise, it'll be too late.
AKIHIKO: No... But I'm not ignoring it, either.
[Main and Akihiko enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Takenozuka is teaching Physics.]
MR. TAKENOZUKA: Exams start next Monday. We're a little ahead of schedule, so
let's review the material. We'll start with the basics:
gravity. What's gravity? A big, heavy object draws a smaller
object to it. That's gravity.
MAIN: 
MR. TAKENOZUKA: When your eraser falls to the ground, that's also
gravity. But when your grades fall in the toilet,
that's not gravity! That's your own damn fault! Write
this down, 'cause I'm about to erase it! Come on!
increased.
[Main puts his head down.]
eyes... You start to feel better... Your condition is
now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===

YUKARI: ...Oh, hey. It's been a week since Ryoji-kun was here... I couldn't
sleep for three days after that. Do you think it's weird for me to be
this scared?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Well, I've some to realize something... You don't really know
how much you take your life for granted... until there's a
possibility you might lose it.
YUKARI: ...Yeah, I guess you're right. You don't really know how much
you take your life for granted... until there's a possibility
you might lose it. It's difficult to explain...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. He meets Mitsuru there.]
MITSURU: Good morning. Did you talk to the others?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: I see... Well, I feel the same as the others. We can't
continue on like this... We should talk with everyone tonight.
MITSURU: But, we can't continue on like this... We should talk with
everyone tonight.
[Main and Mitsuru enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===

[Main enters the dorm to find the others gathered around the table.]
YUKARI: Well, it's been a week. What're we going to do? ...You okay, Fuuka?
FUUKA: You just seem so calm...
YUKARI: We have to make a decision... I mean, it's been such a drag around here
lately, and no one will go to Tartarus...
MITSURU: ...You're right. We humans are quite resilient. We can adapt to any
situation, given enough time. So, how about it, everyone? Why don't we
talk about it?
JUNPEI: ......
KEN: ...Have you made your decision, Sanada-san?
AKIHIKO: No... But, I don't plan on running away.
MITSURU: So you're going to fight Nyx?
AKIHIKO: ...I don't know. I mean, it's supposedly undefeatable. What about you?
What are your thoughts on it?
MITSURU: Honestly, this is the first time I've ever really contemplated my own
death... It's quite a sobering thought. I don't want to suffer... and
I don't want to kill Ryoji. But either way, we still die. So, there is
no simple answer.
FUUKA: Then, do we all agree that we don't want to hurt Ryoji-kun?
AKIHIKO: Is that how you feel?
FUUKA: Well, I, um...
YUKARI: It's okay, Fuuka. I mean, it's not natural to choose how you're going
to die... What about you, Junpei? Have you decided?
JUNPEI: No...
YUKARI: What's the matter? Scared?
JUNPEI: ...What the hell do you mean by that? You think this is a joke?
YUKARI: Junpei, I...
JUNPEI: We're going to die! Of course I'm scared! You all need to wake up! This
is death we're talking about here!
MITSURU: Then, what do you want to do? Do you want to kill him?
JUNPEI: There's nothing I can do... He's the only one who can kill him. Come to
think of it, it's all your fault...  You had that thing inside
you and didn't even know it... You raised it, dammit! This is all your
fault! So you should do something about it! You're supposed to be
"special," right!?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Stop it, Junpei! It's not his fault... And the only reason we've even
been given a choice is because he carried it!
JUNPEI: I know that, dammit! But...
YUKARI: I'm sorry I teased you, Junpei. I was just trying to lighten up the
situation. Personally, I don't want to forget everything. I've learned
so much since coming here.
JUNPEI: I've never really talked about this before, but... My old man was an
alcoholic. He started drinking after he was tricked into investing his
life savings in some telemarketing scam. He drank until he passed out,
so he didn't have to face reality... And I hated him for it... Now, I
understand how he felt. Everything seems hopeless... I'm so scared!
FUUKA: I know how you feel, Junpei-kun. I'm scared too.
AKIHIKO: Yeah, we're all scared.
MITSURU: Yes... I... I can't stop shaking.
YUKARI: Me either...
JUNPEI: Yuka-tan...
MITSURU: Alright, I don't think we're prepared to make a decision just yet.
Ryoji said he'll be back on New Year's Eve, so we still have some time
to think about it. ...So until then, let's just try to live our lives
as normally as possible.
[Everyone nods.]

=== AFTERNOON ===

[Ms. Toriumi is teaching Composition.]
MS. TORIUMI: Exams will begin on Monday. Have you guys studied? It's my fault
if you don't get good scores, you know. Let's consult our
textbooks for today's lesson. Let's see... Ah, yes. Antonyms.
Antonyms are rather difficult, since words can be interpreted in
many different ways. One antonym of "hard" is "soft." But "easy"
could also be an antonym of "hard." You seem confused, Junpei.
Tell me, what's the antonym of "hard," as in "Why are you being so
hard on me?"
JUNPEI: ...Huh? Me? Ughh... I wasn't listening at all... Did you hear what she
said, Main? Do you know the answer?
MAIN: 
MS. TORIUMI: Oh, so you were listening. You've got a funny way of
showing it, though...
JUNPEI: F-Funny way... Yeah, I guess so. ...Thanks, Main.
CLASSMATE: Main helped Junpei out! He's a real nice guy.
MS. TORIUMI: That's completely wrong! Stop daydreaming and listen up!
JUNPEI: Daydreaming...? I-I guess so. Wait, that goes for you too...

=== EVENING ===

MITSURU: Welcome back. Exams begin next week. I know it will be difficult to
study for them, but... If you run away now, you'll just be giving up
on life. Oh, and please let me know when you'll be going to Tartarus.
AKIHIKO: Yeah, let me know too. I need to get some exercise... so I'll explore
with you. I'm not leaving the ring without a win.

=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Ono is teaching Japanese History.]
MR. ONO: Exams start next Monday, so let's go over some historically
significant years. 901: Michizane Sugawara is demoted. 1016: Michinaga
Fujiwara becomes regent. 1156: The Hoden Rebellion. 1159: The Heiji
Rebellion.
MAIN: 
MR. ONO: 1185: Battle of Dan-no-ura. 1192: The Kamakura shogunate is
established. Ooh, we're getting close to the age of the
samurai!

now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? Exams start tomorrow, huh...? Ha! This is the first time
an exam's taken my mind off of something else. Usually it's the other
way around!

=== EARLY MORNING ===


=== MORNING ===

Japanese History Q.3: In what year did the Hogen Rebellion take place?
MAIN:

Chemistry Q.3: Which of the following is used to make tofu?
MAIN:

Japanese Q.7: Which of the following is an example of a pseudo-Anglicism in
Japanese?
MAIN:

Classic Literature Q.3: Why did women of the Heian period put white makeup on
their faces?
MAIN:

Composition Q.4: Which of the following words is not of Arabic origin?
MAIN: 

=== MORNING ===


=== AFTER SCHOOL ===


=== EVENING ===

MITSURU: Welcome back. After exams were finished... I went for a walk around
town... The number of The Lost is increasing. I saw them everywhere
I looked. Perhaps that has to do with the Fall.
MAIN: 
MITSURU: I haven't thought much about it lately... but we're the only
ones who can save the world. It's all up to us.
MITSURU: Yes, I agree. We must continue going to Tartarus until the
very end. Whether our opponent is a Shadow, or whether it is
fate, we will need to be strong to win.

=== DAYTIME ===

[Yukari is in her room. There's a knock at the door.]
YUKARI: Yes? Who is it?
MITSURU: It's me.
YUKARI: Oh...
[Mitsuru enters the room.]
YUKARI: You don't stop by very often, Senpai... Is something wrong?
MITSURU: No, I just wanted to talk.
YUKARI: Awww... Are you feeling lonely?
MITSURU: Hey... Are you teasing me?
YUKARI: No. ...Well, maybe just a little.
MITSURU: 
YUKARI: ...I wonder what this Nyx is like. Hey, do you think it's inside
Tartarus?
MITSURU: I have no idea...
YUKARI: Oh, by the way, I've made my decision... I want to fight to the end.
It's better than doing nothing. That's why you're here, isn't it,
Senpai? To talk about our decision?
MITSURU: I... I guess it is.
Yukari;  You're so easy to read.
MITSURU: I've made my decision as well. Kirijo is making great strides to turn
itself around. After I graduate, I plan to assume leadership of the
Group and continue where my father left off. I cannot turn back now,
even if I wanted to.
YUKARI: But, what if you die?
MITSURU: If I die defeating Nyx, then the Kirijo Group will have to continue on
without me. But I am confident they would fulfill my wishes.
YUKARI: Ryoji said Nyx can't be defeated... but I kinda wonder about that. I
don't think our special member can be killed, either.
MITSURU: I agree... Death dwelled within him, amplifying his abilities, though
he was exceptional to begin with.
YUKARI: He's an interesting guy, huh?
MITSURU: ...Yes, he is.
YUKARI: You know, if things don't work out, I think I'll still be okay, as long
as I'm with everyone. Honestly, it doesn't matter whether or not we
die. All that matters is that we're proud of how we lived. And I'd be
proud if we decided to fight Nyx.
MITSURU: Does your decision have anything to do with your father?
YUKARI: ...A little. But, it's more about me and how I feel.
MITSURU: I understand.
YUKARI: Senpai, when we were in Kyoto, you asked me to stand by your side...
Do you remember?
MITSURU: ...Yes, I remember. We will fight together, Yukari.
YUKARI: ...Together.

=== EVENING ===


=== LUNCHTIME ===

[Main is sitting in his homeroom.]
STUDENT: Hey, the results are posted!
respect! Your Charm has increased. You suddenly remember something.
Mitsuru promised to give you a gift if you scored the highest.

=== AFTERNOON ===

[Mr. Edogawa is teaching.]
MR. EDOGAWA: Right, let's begin. Tohokami emitama... Today, we'll finally talk
about magic right here in Japan. Though I'm sure you think you're
familiar with it already, you probably aren't. The view that magic
is a dubious subculture is becoming more common... But what is
swept into the corners of society today was once central to Japan.
It could even be said that magic was invented in Japan. After all,
Himiko of Yama-taikoku was a shaman. She reportedly used magic
called "Kido" to control the country. Sadly, we have no way of
knowing what kind of sorcery that was... The same is true for
Prince Shotoku, who established a centralized government. He
practiced Onmyodo, so in a sense, he was also a shaman. With
origins like this, magic was naturally woven into the very fabric
of Japan. In the Heian period, for example... The Bereau of Onmyo
was established, for Onmyouji to expel evil spirits and give
spiritual advice. You may be familiar with that from the legend of
Abe no Seimei. Even in the age of the samurai, magicians played
their part. Many generals who studied divination and military
tactics could be considered magicians. Are you all listening?
Don't become mesmerized, now... Eeeheehee. I'll test you to see
how closely you've been paying attention. Get it wrong, and you'll
hear more taboo phrases. Tohokami emitama... Who to call on...
Ah, Main. I ask thee...
[Main stands up.]
MR. EDOGAWA: What sorcery was Himiko said to have used?
MAIN: 
MR. EDOGAWA: Wrong! From today on, the word "petite" will be taboo.
The trend of tying magic to the people continued to the
Edo period, but... The new government formed during the
Meiji Reformation stamped it out. Tsuchimikado Shinto,
which had been revived during the Edo period, faded
away...
MR. EDOGAWA: Very good. Thank your kotodama for that one. The trend of
tying magic to the people continued to the Edo period,
but... The new government formed during the Meiji
Reformation stamped it out. Tsuchimikado Shinto, which had
been revived during the Edo period, faded away...

=== EVENING ===

YUKARI: ...Oh, hey. Today is December 21st. There are less than ten days until
New Year's Eve. But, for some reason, I'm not scared at all. Well,
maybe I'm scared a little... But, I'm still gonna fight. Win or lose,
I'm gonna give it my all.

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===


=== DAYTIME ===

[Ken is standing at the place behind Port Island Station. Akihiko enters and
walks over to him.]
AKIHIKO: I thought you were gonna go visit your mother's grave...
KEN: Oh, hi, Sanada-san...
AKIHIKO: Is this where you should be?
KEN: Well, I was planning to... But when I thought about what I was gonna say
to her, it just didn't feel right. There are things I still need to do
before I talk to her again.
AKIHIKO: Yeah, same here. I don't have anything I need to tell Shinji right
now. ...I have my own stuff to deal with.
KEN: An undefeatable enemy, huh? Gosh, I wonder what it's like.
AKIHIKO: ...You got me. But, it doesn't matter... because I've made up my mind.
I'm gonna look it straight in the eyes.
KEN: ...Straight in the eyes... I like the sound of that. You can count me in,
too!

=== EVENING ===

KEN: ...Hello! There are eight more days until New Year's Eve... Have you made
up your mind yet, Main-san? Well, I have. I'm going to fight. When I
thought about it, I realized that there really wasn't a choice to be made.
I don't want to have to tell my mom and Shinjiro-san that we failed.

=== MORNING ===

[Mrs. Terauchi is teaching.]
MRS. TERAUCHI: Today is December 24th... Christmas Eve. It's an important day
in Europe and America. Although unlike in Japan, December 25th--
Christmas Day--is even more important. Do you all know why we
celebrate Christmas in the first place? In Japan, Christmas Eve
is just a day for couples to spend time together and give
gifts...
MAIN: 
MRS. TERAUCHI: It's interesting that a day whih is celebrated worldwide
is observed differently from country to country. Another
example is Valentine's Day. Try looking it up online, if
you're interested.
increased.
[Main puts his head down.]
eyes... You start to feel better... Your condition is
now "Great"!

=== LUNCHTIME ===

(If you have one of the girlfriend S. Links at 4+, whichever girl you have
highest will call you here to ask you to spend Christmas Eve with them. You
can accept or reject the offer.)

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

(If you chose to spend Christmas with a girl, she'll come get you now for your
date. It will take up both After School and Evening.)

=== EVENING ===


=== EVENING ===

AKIHIKO: ...Where have you been? Hey, did you know that today is December 25th?
Tch... Fate... Death... What a terrible Christmas. Christmas will be
better next year. That's right, next year. We're not gonna let the
world end.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

happened... However, you must still go to school.
[Later, Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Morning! It's cold today, but it's worth it for winter
vacation tomorrow! What are you getting with your New Year's
gift?
LISTENING STUDENT: We haven't got ours yet! But I want to get a luck bag! I'm
aiming for that purse...
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Ooh, me too! Hey, do you want to start waiting in line
today? We could bring a kotatsu..
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Ms. Toriumi is teaching.]
MS. TORIUMI: Winter break starts tomorrow, though I'm sure most of you are just
going to sleep in during New Year's. You'd better stop relying on
your parents so much. For heaven's sake, at least peel your own
oranges. Speaking of oranges, I'm reminded of a famous story:
"...He left it there as if it were a terrible bomb..." Oh, wait...
that was a lemon.
MAIN: 
MS. TORIUMI: All right, that's enough out of you! Oranges and lemons
are both citrus fruits, aren't they!? Teachers make
mistakes too! Anyway, you should be focusing on the
reasons for Kajii's depiction of the lemon as a bomb!
increased.
[Main puts his head down.]
eyes... You start to feel better... Your condition is
now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===

MITSURU: Welcome back. The second term has finally ended... There are only five
days left until New Year's Eve. My fear and anxiety still remain...
but I'm no longer confused. I will fight until the end... I've made up
my mind.

=== EARLY MORNING ===


=== DAYTIME ===

[Junpei is sitting in Port Island Station looking at Chidori's sketchbook.]
FUUKA: Huh...? Junpei-kun?
[Fuuka walks over to him.]
JUNPEI: Oh, hey, Fuuka.
FUUKA: What are you doing here?
JUNPEI: Nothing, really... I come here when I'm feeling down...
FUUKA: Is that Chidori's sketchbook...?
[Junpei closes the sketchbook.]
JUNPEI: Yeah. This was where I first met her... What're you doing here, Fuuka?
FUUKA: Oh, I went home for a bit. I've been going back there a lot lately.
JUNPEI: I see. You know, you've really changed, Fuuka. You're totally different
from when you first came to the dorm.
FUUKA: Really...?
JUNPEI: Yeah. You were so timid back then, but now you're so... strong.
FUUKA: You've changed too, Junpei-kun.
JUNPEI: Yuka-tan said the same thing. But I don't think so. I mean, just the
other day I got all freaked out about being scared... I'm such a
wuss...
FUUKA: That's not true.
JUNPEI: But, I really was scared. Actually... I'm still scared. ...But after
thinking about it, I realized that I don't want to lose my memory. If
I forget everything, that means I'll forget Chidori, too. ...And I
wouldn't even be alive right now if it wasn't for her, ya know? ...So
I say "f" that.
FUUKA: You're scared because you're not running away... That's nothing to be
ashamed of.
JUNPEI: Fuuka...
FUUKA: That's why I want to protect everyone... Think about it. The Dark Hour
is really scary too, isn't it? But our Personas awakened, and we're here
today... The future hasn't been decided yet... And I want to be true to
myself...
JUNPEI: True to yourself... You're really something, Fuuka. We should fight.
FUUKA: I agree.

=== EVENING ===

FUUKA: ...Hi, how was your day? Four more days until New Year's Eve... I've
been thinking about what I'm going to do on the 31st... I was afraid I
might go crazy from fear... But, I was wrong. I feel strong... because
everyone is with me.

=== EVENING ===

FUUKA: ...Hi, how was your day? There are three more days until New Year's Eve.
Have you decided what you're going to say to Ryoji-kun?

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? The day's almost here... I've made up my mind; I'm gonna
fight with all I've got. And I know we're gonna win. I got so confused
thinking about it, but then I figured it out... Whatever Nyx is, all
we have to do is kill it!

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main is in his room. There's a knock at the door.]
YUKARI: Hey, it's me. Can I talk to you?
MAIN: 
[Main opens the door.]
YUKARI: Hey, I have good news... Aigis is coming back today! Misuru-
senpai said her wounds have finally healed. We're meeting in
the lounge tonight. Don't forget, okay? See ya!
[She leaves.]
YUKARI: Oh, it's okay. I just wanted to tell you the good news. Aigis
is coming back today! Mitsuru-senpai said her wounds have
finally healed. We're meeting in the lounge tonight. Don't
forget, okay? See ya!

=== EVENING ===

[Everyone is gathered in the lounge.]
AIGIS: I'm back, everyone. Sorry to have worried you all.
JUNPEI: Man, I'm glad to see you. I was getting nervous.
FUUKA: Me too. I was fearing the worst...
AIGIS: I'm a machine, so I can always be rebuilt. Even if I was completely
destroyed, the programming data necessary to recreate me would still
exist...
YUKARI: Hey... Don't talk about yourself like that.
MITSURU: They said another week would be required for a complete recovery, but
I had the process expedited. ...Tomorrow is New Year's Eve.
AIGIS: I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused... Mitsuru-san visited me at
the lab and told me everything... That must have been difficult for you
all to hear.  Have you been well...? I mean, considering the
circumstances...
MAIN: 
AIGIS: If that's true, then I'm relieved.
AIGIS: I'm sorry. It's because I wasn't strong enough...
AIGIS: Ten years ago, I... What I did to you was... ......
MAIN: 
AIGIS: But... If I hadn't done that to you, you wouldn't be suffering like
this... Ryoji has presented you with a difficult choice... Have you
made your decision?
MAIN: 
AIGIS: ...I have a favor to ask of you. Tomorrow, when Ryoji comes, please...
Please kill him...! I can't bear to see everyone hurting like this!
Please choose to have your memories erased...! Even if... Even if it
means forgetting everything... and everyone...
YUKARI: A-Aigis, what're you talking about!?
JUNPEI: Yeah, this isn't like you.
AIGIS: ......
MITSURU: What's wrong, Aigis?
AIGIS: Why...? Why did I come back here? My mission is to protect humanity from
Shadows. But now, I know that I can't defeat them! So then... why am
I here? I'm useless! I cannot even shed a tear for you all...!
FUUKA: Oh, Aigis...
AIGIS: Why fight, when you know that you can't win!? What is the purpose of
that!? Why are you wasting your lives!?
AKIHIKO: We're not wasting our lives. We're just planning for the future.
Right, Ken?
KEN: Right.
AIGIS: I... I don't understand.  It must be because I don't possess a
"life"...
JUNPEI: This has nothing to do with having a life.
AIGIS: I'm a machine, a machine that was created to protect humans from
Shadows. But, I can't fulfill that mission with the powers I was
given... So then, what is my purpose now? Could someone please tell me?
[Aigis drops to her knees.]
JUNPEI: We don't know the answer, Aigis... The only one who can tell you what
your purpose is, is you. That's why we're having such a hard time
making our decision. There's just no easy answer. Bu as long as we're
alive, we have to do something... When we see others hurting, we want
to help them. So that's our purpose.
AIGIS: Can finding one's purpose really be so simple...?
[Fuuka crouches down next to Aigis.]
FUUKA: When I saw you collapse, I realized something... I want to protect
you... I don't want to forget about you.
AIGIS: Fuuka-san...
MITSURU: There are times when you will lose sight of your goal, and you will
have to search for it. But if you can't find it again, then you must
set your heart on a new goal. To truly live, you will need to make
changes sometimes.
AIGIS: Do you think I can do that? Do you think I can change?
MITSURU: Yes. I mean, you've changed so much already. ...Haven't you noticed?
In fact, you're changing even as we speak.
[Aigis looks at Fuuka, who nods. They both stand up.]
AIGIS: I know what my purpose is... I'm a machine, a machine who is here to
"live." And the one who has given me this new purpose is... me.
YUKARI: Aigis...
AIGIS: This is the promise I've made to myself. I don't know how I'll do it...
but I guess that is a part of living, too. Will you allow me to join
with you all?
JUNPEI: Of course! You've always been one of us.
AIGIS: ...Thank you! I will be with you all... no matter what happens...!
[Palladion appears above Aigis and changes into another Persona.]
[Athena disappears.]

=== EARLY MORNING ===


=== EVENING ===

[Ryoji and the party members are gathered in the lounge.]
RYOJI: Hey, long time no see... Midnight's just around the corner... At
midnight, I will change from this form into something unrecognizable.
So, have you reached a decision? Okay, I'll be waiting in his room until
midnight. Come see me when you have your answer.
[Ryoji starts to walk away.]
FUUKA: Ryoji-kun...
RYOJI: Oh, and one more thing. Don't let the fact that you'll have to kill me
influence your decision. As I said before, I'm going to disappear
anyways. I won't feel any pain by "dying". So, there's no need to worry
about me.
JUNPEI: ......
RYOJI: I'll be waiting...
[Ryoji walks off.]
MITSURU: Have you made your decision?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: ...I see.
MITSURU: I understand. You don't need to say anything.
MITSURU: Have the rest of you made your decision?
AKIHIKO: No need to ask me.
YUKARI: You know how I feel.
JUNPEI: I wouldn't be here if I wasn't on board.
FUUKA: I'm with the rest of you.
KEN: I'm in, too.
AIGIS: I have made my decision as well.
MITSURU: Then, we're all in agreement, yes?
AKIHIKO: Better let him know, then. ...Okay?
[Main nods and goes up to his room. Ryoji is sitting on the bed.]
RYOJI: Hey. It's been a long time since we talked like this in your room.
Although back then, I didn't appear in this form, and wasn't known by
this name.
[Main doesn't say anything.]
RYOJI: Don't tell me you've all decided to let me live... You're all going to
risk your lives on a battle you can't win. But, you're the only one here
right now, so... I'll say this one more time. If you kill me, Tartarus,
the Dark Hour, and your memories of the battles will all disappear.
Tomorrow, you'll wake up a normal high-school student. You'll be able
to live in peace until the moment of the Fall. But if you let me live,
you'll spend every waking moment until that day in fear of your
inevitable death. Nyx cannot be defeated... It's useless to fight her.
[Ryoji stands up.]
RYOJI: ...Are you still thinking? Or, have you already made up your mind?
MAIN: 
RYOJI: I guess my words didn't change your mind... There's still some time
until midnight. I didn't want to have to show you this... but I have no
choice.
[Ryoji transforms into Thanatos.]
Ryoji's New Form: See...? I'm not human. I will bring death to this world until
I am finally satiated. Do not hesitate to kill me. ...I
want you to think about this carefully. Is facing Nyx really
the best decision...? Right now, you are all confused by the
truth. But some things in this world cannot be changed. You
do not understand this yet. Memories are ambiguous... Old
ones can be replaced with new ones, creating a new reality.
Don't you want to end all your friends' pain and suffering?
...It's up to you. You're the only one who can make this
decision. Now, this is your last chance. Tell me your
answer...
MAIN: 
[Ryoji changes back to normal.]
RYOJI: ...... ...... I understand. It's regrettable, but it's your life... You
can do what you want with it. I will respect your decision. Let's go
back to the lounge. I need to tell you guys how to confront Nyx.
[Main and Ryoji return to the lounge.]
JUNPEI: Yo! What's up, Ryoji?
RYOJI: It's an unfortunate decision... but it is yours to make.
YUKARI: That's right.
RYOJI: But you can't defeat Nyx... It's impossible.
MITSURU: But we must still try.
AKIHIKO: Personally, I don't care if it is impossible.
RYOJI: ...I understand. It's almost midnight, so I'll keep this brief. I'll
tell you where to find Nyx. ...She'll be at Tartarus. You must reach the
top of the tower before the promised day.
YUKARI: When's the promised day...?
RYOJI: Exactly one month from tomorrow... January 31st, 2010. Nyx will descend
to Tartarus... and the world will end. If you go to the top of Tartarus
on that day, you'll be able to face her. The tower exists for the
purpose of Nyx's coming. As The Appriser, I usher Nyx into this world...
and Tartarus welcomes her arrival.
AKIHIKO: The tower exists for the purpose of Nyx's coming... That's why it's
called the "Tower of Demise." So if we reach the top, we can fight
Nyx?
RYOJI: Yes, but remember... From today, you will fight against eternal despair.
Like I've said so many times before, Nyx cannot be defeated. When you
face her, you will finally understand this truth. And then, you will
realize what it is you are trying to stand against.
MITSURU: ...We understand. There's no need to keep telling us. January 31st...
We won't forget that date.
RYOJI: Well, I'll be going on ahead of you, then. I want to leave you while I'm
still in this form.
FUUKA: Ryoji-kun...
JUNPEI: ......
[Ryoji starts for the door as everyone stands up. He stops.]
RYOJI: Aigis... I'm sorry for all the pain and suffering I put you through.
AIGIS: I won't forget that you were my enemy... and my friend.
YUKARI: Aigis...
RYOJI: Thank you. This will probably be the last time I see you all like this.
But... I'll always be watching over you. ...Well, goodbye.
[Ryoji walks to the door and opens it, then looks back.]
RYOJI: Best wishes in the coming year. That's what you say on New Year's Eve,
right? See ya!
[Ryoji leaves.]
JUNPEI: Heh, that Ryoji...
[Fool Arcana to rank 10.]
them has grown stronger, and reached a new level of closeness...
[Judgement Social Link is established. The scene fades out.]
able to face Nyx. You must reach the top of Tartarus by that day. This is the
decision you have all made. ...... 2009 is quietly drawing to a close; it was
a year filled with many memories...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main, Akihiko, and Koromaru are at the lounge table. Ken peeks in before
entering.]
KEN: Happy New Year, Senpai!
MAIN: 
KEN: Let's make this the best year ever!
KEN: Uh, yes.
KEN: Uh, yes.
KEN: It's New Years, but there's nothing really special to do.
AKIHIKO: Well, you can always wish people a New Year's greeting... Like, "Have
a great year!"
KEN: Yeah.
[Ken crouches down and pets Koromaru.]
KEN: Happy New Year to you too, Koro.
KOROMARU: Arf!
[Junpei walks in.]
JUNPEI: Oh man... I completely overslept. Why'd I stay up all night watching
that stupid movie...? Did you guys see it? It had these giant Amazon
women running around in the jungle...
AKIHIKO: Why would I watch that?
KEN: Um, is anyone gonna visit the shrine?
AKIHIKO: No. I don't believe in superstitions.
JUNPEI: Me either...
KEN: Oh, that's too bad. Yukari-san and the others are already there. They're
all wearing kimonos.
JUNPEI: ...Kimonos, huh?
[Junpei starts to walk off.]
JUNPEI: ...Um, I'm gonna run to--
AKIHIKO: Hold it right there, Junpei.
JUNPEI: ...Uh, what?
AKIHIKO: You're going to the shrine, aren't you?
JUNPEI: N-No, I'm not... I'm just going for a walk...
AKIHIKO: ...Oh yeah? Well, I'm going with you, then. I'm bored.
KEN: ...Oh, I'll go too!
JUNPEI: Alright then, let's go.  You coming?
AKIHIKO: ...Anyone know where it is?
KEN: ...Yeah, the girls told me the directions.
JUNPEI: ...Sweet!

=== DAYTIME ===

[The guys arrive at the shrine. The girls walk over to them.]
YUKARI: Happy New Year! Let's all do our very best this year! Hey, you guys are
late. We were just about to leave.
JUNPEI: Y-Yuka-tan...
YUKARI: Wh-What?
[Junpei looks at Mitsuru.]
MITSURU: Happy New Year! ...Hm? What's the matter, Iori?
JUNPEI: Mitsuru-senpai... You look hot... I, um... heh... I mean...
MITSURU: S-Stop staring at me...
FUUKA: Um, I've never word a kimono before... Does my sash look okay?
JUNPEI: Fuuka... You look... Wow!
FUUKA: G-Geez...
AIGIS: This traditional clothing is quite interesting. However, it's quite
difficult to move in...
JUNPEI: Ah... I'm so glad I came... New Year's kicks ass! Yah!
AIGIS: Junpei-san, why are you acting so strange?
JUNPEI: Man, we got to see some great stuff today. Right, Akihiko-senpai?
AKIHIKO: Uh... I-I guess so.
KEN: Hey, aren't you guys cold?
YUKARI: A little, but I love this time of year...
KEN: Um, that's not what I meant... Junpei-san said that you guys aren't
wearing anything underneath your kimonos.
FUUKA: He said WHAT...?
[Yukari stomps on Junpei's foot.]
JUNPEI: OW!
[Later, everyone is about to leave.]
YUKARI: What did you wish for, Fuuka?
FUUKA: I... I wished for a great year. It's a bit generic, but that's what I
really want.
MITSURU: That's what I want as well.
YUKARI: How funny... We all wished for the same thing.
MITSURU: But, it wasn't a plea for help. I know that we'll be victorious.
FUUKA: We should get going.
[The party returns to the dorm.]

=== EVENING ===

[Main has just arrived at the dorm when his phone rings.]
VOICE ON THE PHONE: Hello? This is Elizabeth.
ELIZABETH: I'm calling to inform you of a change in Tartarus... I believe a
path that was blocked is now open... I thought you might like to
know. ...I wish you a safe journey.

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? Hey, let's go to Tartarus. We can't just sit around here
and do nothing, you know.

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===


=== EVENING ===

YUKARI: ...Oh, hey. Have you noticed those weird symbols and posters all over
town? They really creep me out. Nyx must be affecting everyone's mind.
We should go to Tartarus. A month's gonna totally fly by, ya know.

=== EVENING ===


=== EVENING ===

MITSURU: Welcome back. We should go to Tartarus tonight, . Our goal
now is to reach the top of Tartarus. We cannot falter... We have to
do all that we can.

=== EARLY MORNING ===


=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Later, Main arrives at the school gate. A boy and a girl are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Hey, have you heard of this cult?
LISTENING STUDENT: Hey, don't call it that if you don't know anything about it.
The Fall is coming; it's already decided.
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Oh... Well, if it's already decided, then it can't be
helped. By the way, about the homework for second period...
[Main and the student enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Ms. Toriumi is teaching.]
MS. TORIUMI: Happy New Year, everyone. Winter break is over now. No more
booze... Oh, you guys are underage. Wow, I feel sorry for you.
Well! Let's get right down to business. It's a new year, so we'll
start with the basics. This is composition class, right? Well
then, Main.
[Main stands up.]
MS. TORIUMI: Tell me which is correct: "He isn't," or "He's not."
MAIN: 
MS. TORIUMI: Bzzzzt! They're actually both correct. It was a trick
question. Man, I can just imagine what your fortune will
be like this year... Anyway, they're both contractions for
"He is not." Now, according to most scholars...
MS. TORIUMI: That's absolutely right. In the end, they're both
contractions for "He is not." Now, according to
scholars...

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[The juniors are in their homeroom. Yukari leaves, and Junpei walks over to
Main.]
JUNPEI: Hey, you busy? Could you come with me for a sec?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Whoa, rejected! Come on, man. It'll just take a few minutes.
JUNPEI: Oh, it's no big deal... Come on, man. It'll just take a few
minutes.
JUNPEI: Let's go to the rooftop.
[They go up to the rooftop and look out on the city.]
JUNPEI: Hey, we've never really had a chance to talk, have we? It's almost
Coming of Age Day, ya know. I used to just think of it as a day off...
But now, I wonder if I'm even gonna live long enough to celebrate it...
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Yeah, I guess you're right.
JUNPEI: It's been pretty weird around here lately... People have been passing
out, others have gone missing... Dude, it's crazy. Senpai said it's
because there are too many Shadow victims and the memory revision can't
keep up. ...It's all gotta be because of this Nyx. Oh, and have you
heard about that doomsday cult? They've been running around town
telling everyone they see that the end of the world is coming... Man,
we need to do something, and quick.
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Yeah, I guess they can somehow sense what's going to happen.
JUNPEI: But, it's not just Nyx, ya know... Two members of Strega are still
alive. They haven't done anything yet, but I know they've gotta be
planning something. And we need to take care of them, too. Wow...
Becoming such good friends that I'd trust you with my life...
I never would've imagined that happening last spring. But then again,
I never thought it would come to this. Ya know, I don't think it's
completely hit me yet... It's just all so hard to believe... But, that
doesn't mean we should just sit around and wait for it to happen.
You're pretty cool, man. That thing was inside you for ten years, and
you harnessed its power and made it your own... I'm glad I met you.
It's embarrassing to say it, but... that's really how I feel. We'll
always be friends, right? I mean, even after this is all over?
MAIN: 
[Main and Junpei both nod.]
JUNPEI: Heh... You're a punk.
JUNPEI: Cool.

=== EVENING ===

AKIHIKO: ...Where have you been? This term seems like any other term. I don't
care about what's going to happen to the world... All I'm going to do
is keep moving forward... So, let me know when you want to go to
Tartarus.

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? Only three more weeks 'til X-Day. But, it's weird... I
was pissin' my pants all last month. But, since I decided that I was
gonna fight, I'm not scared anymore. ...Hey, let's go to Tartarus, man.
We gotta do what we can do, right?

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===


=== EVENING ===

KEN: ...Hello! Today is Coming of Age Day. I don't want my life to end before
I become an adult. Hey, let's go to Tartarus tonight. I don't want to see
the world end...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Lately, even the late-night comedy shows have been talking
about the end of the world... It feels creepy.
LISTENING STUDENT: Are you still talking about that? By the way... I wanted to
show you this magazine that hit the stands today.
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Magazine...? Don't tell me it's about cults.
LISTENING STUDENT: Well, just read it for yourself. You'll see how true it
really is.
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== AFTERNOON ===

[Ms. Ounishi is teaching.]
MS. OUNISHI: Whew, it's cold. Do you all know why you get goosebumps in cold
weather? The pores on your skin contract to prevent body heat from
escaping. The human body is amazing... The stars shine beautifully
at this time of year, through the crisp, clean air...
MAIN: 
MS. OUNISHI: ...Stars produce light via nuclear fusion, and visible
planets reflect the stars' light. That's not to say that
one's superior to the other... They both have their own
purposes. Life is the same way, though it might be hard
for you kids to understand that now. Have you heard the
news that's going around now? The media makes it sound
supernatural... But, don't listen to them. That kind of
rumor spreads every now and then, like a drop of dye on a
specimen. It'll die down soon.
increased.
[Main puts his head down.]
eyes... You start to feel better... Your condition is
now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===

[Main arrives at the dorm; Junpei meets him at the door.]
JUNPEI: Oh, there you are. We're all going to Hagakure. Wanna come?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Wow, that was easy.
JUNPEI: What're you on a diet or something?
JUNPEI: ...You're joking, right?
JUNPEI: ...Akihiko-san's buying. You remember that bet we made in Yakushima?
Oh, you probably forgot all about it by now. Well, you won in the
end... even if it was Aigis. But whatever, Akihiko-san still lost,
right? It took me like six months to make him accept that fact... So
c'mon, everyone else already left. We gotta hurry!
[They leave and go to Hagakure. Yukari, Akihiko, and Aigis are already there.]
YUKARI: Is the special okay for everyone?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Okay, five specials, please!
YUKARI: Okay, five specials, please!
YUKARI: Okay, four specials and one regular, please!
[The cook begins making the meals.]
JUNPEI: Man, this is awesome! Akihiko-san's NEVER treated us all to ramen
before.
AKIHIKO: Hey, why do I have to treat everyone?
JUNPEI: Tch, not this again... Come on, Akihiko-san, a bet's a bet. Pay up!
AKIHIKO: Alright, alright! I never said I wouldn't.
[Akihiko picks up a magazine. He and Aigis look at it.]
AIGIS: This article looks quite disturbing... "Emergence of a Messiah: The
Charismatic One Speaks"
YUKARI: It must be about that doomsday cult. They're all over the Internet,
too.
[Akihiko turns the page.]
AKIHIKO: Wh-What the...!?
AIGIS: There's a picture of their leader...
[EVeryone crowds around to see the article.]
YUKARI: Hey... that's...
JUNPEI: I-Is that Takaya!?
AKIHIKO: ...I thought something was up. So, Strega's behind that cult... Tch,
I've lost my appetite.
AIGIS: Listen to what he says... "Mankind is currently imprisoned by the sins
of hate and anger. But soon, a savior will descend upon this world to
break the chains that bind us, and lift us to new heights. This great
being is Nyx. I have beheld her glory, and she has blessed me with power
beyond belief. In Nyx there is no pain... no suffering..."
JUNPEI: How the hell does he know about Nyx!?
YUKARI: Wait, he's saying that Nyx will save the world!? That's not true!
AKIHIKO: I don't think he really means what he's saying. This is all just a
game to him.
JUNPEI: That son of a bitch...
AIGIS: "But, there are those who do not understand this truth, even though they
have also been blessed by her. They have acquired the same power as I;
yet they abuse it, using it for their own personal gain. These
miscreants are the ones to blame for the recent tragedies that have been
plaguing our streets."
JUNPEI: Wait, is he talking about us!?
YUKARI: Shhh! Not so loud!
JUNPEI: Oh, sorry. Hey, what's up with them calling him the "charismatic one"?
How'd he get so popular all of a sudden!?
AKIHIKO: Well, Jin's pretty well-known on the Internet... He's probably pretty
good at stirring up trouble.
YUKARI: Yeah, I bet he orchestrated Takaya's rise to fame... Ugh, those two
make me sick...
AIGIS: "Brothers and sisters, I shall go forth to make preparations for Nyx's
arrival... But, do not fear those evildoers who desecrate their gifts.
Nyx shall right their wrongs. May your hearts be filled with peace as
you await your salvation. Blessed are those who take joy in the coming
of Nyx. The revolution is here!"
JUNPEI: "Revolution"!? People can't seriously be buying this crap, can they?
AIGIS: Throughout history, those who have changed the future have often been
highly charismatic... That's the end of the article. It appears that
after the interview, Jin and Takaya disappeared again.
AKIHIKO: Well, there's only one place they could've gone--Tartarus. They
must've been planning this all along.
AIGIS: Takaya's words have changed the mood of the entire city. Even though
they won't admit it, they are all afraid...
YUKARI: Yeah... I mean, why else would people believe this nonsense Takaya's
preaching?
AKIHIKO: I guess people just need something to believe in.
JUNPEI: Well, no wonder there's a sense of doom in the air... We're all gonna
die.
AIGIS: But, is that so surprising? The fact that all life ends one day has
nothing to do with Nyx. Death is a natural occurrence in the cycle of
life. Don't all humans realize this?
YUKARI: I guess...
JUNPEI: To tell you the truth, I never even would've thought about my own death
if none of this had happened. But since we've made up our minds, why
don't we just leave it at that? Our objective is Nyx. If Strega gets in
our way, we'll just have to deal with them too.
AKIHIKO: I agree. We'll probably run into them at Tartarus anyways... However
you look at it, we're the obstacle standing in their way.
YUKARI: The promised day will soon be here...
JUNPEI: ...Yeah.
AKIHIKO: We need to do all we can until then.
JUNPEI: Yeah, and we're gonna need lots of energy! So let's eat!
Excuse me! I'd like to order a Hagakure Bowl! You don't mind,
do you, Akihiko-san?
YUKARI: Junpei, don't forget you're having half of Aigis's food too.
JUNPEI: Oh, don't worry. I'm starving.
AKIHIKO: ...You just better eat it all.

=== EVENING ===

FUUKA: ...Hi, how was your day? It's already the middle of January. Since today
is the 13th, we only have 18 more days. Let's go to Tartarus today. Even
though I might be overdoing it, I still want to do as much as I can
right now...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: I got a flyer at Paulownia Mall when I went last time. It's
the same one that's plastered all over the city.
LISTENING STUDENT: The one with the NYX logog?
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Oh, so that's how it's pronouned... I just like the logo's
design. The stuff written here is kinda interesting, too.
Maybe I should ask them about it next time...
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===


=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Ono is teaching.]
MR ONO: Finally, on September 24th, the Satsuma Rebellion ended... This
marked the end...  The end of the age... of the samurai...!
...We're going to skip the next chapter and go back to the Sengoku
era. There's much more to cover... Hm? Modern history? Who gives a damn
about modern history!? People keep talking about the strange illnesses,
and the end of the world... But, mankind has made it this far. I'm sure
we'll make it through this, too.
MAIN: 
MR. ONO: So, back to the Kamakura era. Now, how did the Kamakura
shogunate come about? Well, I'll tell you...

[Main puts his head down.]
eyes... You start to feel better... Your condition is
now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===

AIGIS: ...Greetings. Um... Let's go to Tartarus tonight. ...It's been a while
since I've suggested we go. Ever since I was at the lab, I've been so
confused... But, I'm not confused anymore. I want to fight... with you.

=== EVENING ===

YUKARI: ...Oh, hey. Um... Did you know that Mitsuru-senpai and Akihiko-senpai
went to take their entrance exams today? I can't believe they can
concentrate with all that's going on.
AKIHIKO: It's no big deal. I'm not going to give up.
MITSURU: I suppose we are going against fate... But, I want to do as much as I
can right now. ...I don't want to give up on the future.
AKIHIKO: By the way, if you're going to Tartarus, I'll go with you. There are
two more weeks until the last battle. I can't forget that because of
an exam.
YUKARI: W-Wow... That makes me wanna do my best too...

=== EVENING ===


=== MORNING ===

[Mr. Edogawa is teaching.]
MR. EDOGAWA: Let's get started. Xilka, Xilka, Besa, Besa... Lately, there's
been a lot going on in the world... But, you shouldn't let it get
to you. Common people are too susceptible to occult knowledge. The
worst thing a magician can do is lose control. Always do what must
be done, and you'll be fine. Anyway... Today's lecture is on the
magic of Greece. Greece is known as the birthplace of Western
philosophy and rationality, but... The art of curses advanced
right alongside them. Philosophers such as Socrates, Thales, and
Plato were Greek, but... It was also the home to legendary
enchantresses. For example, there was Medea, the passionate
sorceress of Colchis. She was a withc who didn't hesitate to kill
her brother, or even her own children. Then there was Circe,
daughter of Helios, who was an expert in both poison and medicine.
Without Hermes' help, the legendary Odysseus would have been
changed into a pig. ...These may have only been myths, but reading
between the lines, you can see Greek's views on magic. Greek magic
began to take shape around the 8th century B.C. It was around the
same time that the poleis, or city-states, were developing. Like
many ancient civilizations, they worshipped protector gods. There
were temples that priestesses tended; these women would double as
oracles. Gradually, however, these ceremonies were performed in
secret rather than in public. The reason for this was the people's
desire to monopolize the power of the gods. They copied the
barbaric practices of legend; sacrifices, drinking, orgiastic
festivals... Dangerous acts such as these became widespread.
Apollo, Dionysus, Orpheus... These were the gods they invoked when
performing the rituals. ...Are you all listening? Don't cross the
river Styx, now... Eeeheehee. I'll test to see if you were
listening or not. Get it wrong, and your aura will shift... Xilka,
Xilka, Besa, Besa... Now, who should I pick? I choose thee...
Main!
[Main stands up.]
MR. EDOGAWA: I mentioned two Greek sorceresses. One was Medea; who was the
other?
MAIN: 
MR. EDOGAWA: Wrong! Your aura is now as cloudy as chocolate mints. It
was secrecy like that which turned priestesses into
sorceresses. Teachings originally meant to bring salvation
to the body and soul fell into mere drunken orgies...
luring people to the hideous path of immorality.
Necrophilia, using babies for potion ingredients... This
is where the abominable "black arts" began...
MR. EDOGAWA: Very good! Your aura is as clear as a mountain spring. It
was secrecy like that which turned priestesses into
sorceresses. Teachings originally meant to bring salvation
to the body and soul fell into mere drunken orgies...
luring people to the hideous path of immorality.
Necrophilia, using babies for potion ingredients... This
is where the abominable "black arts" began...

=== EVENING ===

KOROMARU: ..Arf arf!
AIGIS: He's saying that he wants to go to Tartarus tonight...
FUUKA: Koro-chan...
YUKARI: You really are our ally...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: It's getting cold... I hate to even get out from
under the covers these days. Apathy Syndrome doesn't sound
so bad, if you really think about it...
LISTENING STUDENT: I know, right? I could sleep all day, and people would get
all concerned for me!
GOSSIPING STUDENT: I know! Maybe I'll try becoming one... Just for a while.
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== EVENING ===


=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? Hey man, let's go to Tartarus tonight! Only eleven days
left! We gotta do this!

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A boy and a girl are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Our Career Counseling is next week, right? Are you planning
to go to a university, Yumi?
LISTENING STUDENT: Yup! I'm going to school overseas!
GOSSIPING STUDENT: Overs...? This is the first I've heard about this...! I-I'm
your boyfriend...! You have to tell me this stuff!
[Main and the students enter the school.]

=== MORNING ===

[Ms. Miyahara is teaching.]
MS. MIYAHARA: It's been restless out there lately. Have you seen all those
flyers at the station? But none of that stuff has any
credibility. There's no certainty in what they say. That's
right... It's a matter of probability! Hey, don't give me those
looks. The end of the world... Let's discuss this with respect to
probability.
MAIN: 
MS. MIYAHARA: ...So as you can see, you can't prove the end of the
world is nigh. Which means you shouldn't worry about it.
Instead, take a good look at the elegance of this
proof...

now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===


=== EVENING ===

AKIHIKO: ...Where have you been? One week until the 31st, huh... I think you
already know this, but... Once you go into Tartarus on the 31st, you
won't be able to leave until the battle is over. If we lose, there
won't be a tomorrow... and we won't get a chance at a rematch. You
should spend this week getting prepared for the fight.

=== EVENING ===


=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at the school gate. A pair of girls are talking.]
GOSSIPING STUDENT: I've heard a lot of talk lately about salvation, and the
world becoming renewed. If the Apathy Syndrome is becoming
widespread, maybe that's a good thing...
LISTENING STUDENT: Yeah, I'm always hearing people talk about it on TV. I
thought it was a cult at first, but maybe it isn't...
GOSSIPING STUDENT: I mean, if the whole world believes in it, I'd feel pretty
stupid to be the only one denying it.
[Main and the girls enter the school.]

=== AFTERNOON ===

[Mrs. Terauchi is teaching.]
MRS. TERAUCHI: We've come to the last chapter in the textbook. You've all been
such good students this year... My class is almost over! I'll be
moving to India with my husband in the spring. He's a
sociology professor who specializes in Indian culture, so he
wants to spend some time there. Plus... Well, I love Japan, but
there have been so many strange incidents lately. ...But back to
the lesson. Here's a question for you, Main.
[Main stands up.]
MRS. TERAUCHI: What's the best way to say farewell to a teacher?
MAIN: 
MRS. TERAUCHI: You don't want me to go...? Do you guys miss me so much
that you're telling me in Japanese? I'm so proud of each
and every one of you...
MRS. TERAUCHI: Yes! First and foremost, you should express your
gratitude. I'm so proud of each and every one of you...

=== AFTER SCHOOL ===

[Main is meeting with Ms. Toriumi for Career Counseling.]
MS. TORIUMI: Let's begin, shall we? I don't have much to say, though. In the
end, it's your decision. Alright, first question... Are you
planning on going to college after you graduate, or entering the
workforce?
MAIN: 
MS. TORIUMI: ...I see. Well, if you've given serious thought to your
decision, then I believe that is what you should do.
MS. TORIUMI: ...I see. Well, if you've given serious thought to your
decision, then I believe that is what you should do.
MS. TORIUMI: Well, you still have another year until you graduate...
It's okay if you still haven't decided. Just don't put off
for too long.
MS. TORIUMI: Now, it's important to keep in mind that this decision is yours,
and yours alone. If someone else makes it for you, you'll regret
it later. And then you'll have to live with the consequences,
whatever they may be. But, to be honest, I'm quite confident in
you. You've really matured over this last year. I'm sure you're
aware of it as well. ...What do you think has helped to bring
about this change the most?
MAIN: 
MS. TORIUMI: ...I see. Well, whatever the reason, you should be proud of the
young man you've become. That's all for now. I hope you have a
successful senior year. Let's see, uh... who's next? ...Ah,
Aigis-san. Would you mind letting her know?
[Main nods.]
MS. TORIUMI: Thank you.
[Main goes up to the rooftop, where he finds Aigis.]
MAIN: 
AIGIS: ...? I'm sorry I went off on my own...
AIGIS: ...It's nothing, really. I just needed some time to think...
[Main walks over to her.]
AIGIS: When I finally calmed down after New Year's, I realized something...
When I fought Ryoji... I got really scared when my consciousness began
to fade. But, that wasn't all... I was also confused and embarrassed
when I realized I couldn't defeat him... But, I couldn't defeat him ten
years ago either, and I didn't have those feelings then... I... I really
have changed...
MAIN: 
AIGIS: I've been thinking a lot about this change that's occurred in me. You
know, in the past if I didn't understand something, I would just ask
someone to explain it to me. But since I've decided to "live," no one's
been able to answer the questions I have been facing... However, there
is one thing I've come to understand. The reason why I wanted to be
close to you was so I could monitor "Death"... But...
MAIN: 
AIGIS: Even though "Death" is gone now, I... I still want to be by your side...
[There is a long pause.]
AIGIS: I still don't know what it means to "live" yet. But, I want to learn the
answer. And I think I can, if I'm with you... So, please! Please take me
with you! I may not be strong enough... but I'll fight with you to the
end! Please...
MAIN: 
AIGIS: ......! Thank you...!
[The scene fades out.]
You leave the rooftop with Aigis.

=== EVENING ===

FUUKA: ...Hi, how was your day? Today might be our "last" Monday... If we don't
win, there won't be another.
AIGIS: We'll be fine.
FUUKA: Aigis...?
AIGIS: We'll win. ...We have no other choice.
YUKARI: You're right, Aigis... We have to win...

=== EVENING ===

YUKARI: ...Oh, hey. Only fives days until the promised day. Well, we're going
to break that "promise." ...Hey, do you wanna go to Tartarus tonight?
...I want to be ready.

=== EVENING ===

AKIHIKO: ...Where have you been? Four more days... I'm up for going to Tartarus
whenever you want. We've come so far... Nothing's more important than
this.

=== MORNING ===

[Ms. Toriumi is teaching.]
MS. TORIUMI: Let's see... today is the last composition class for January. As
they say, January walks, and February runs... It'll be another new
year in a flash. But before that, we've got our final exams, so
don't get too relaxed! Anyway, just look at me--I manage to come
to school every day, so you can too. Even though if I had the
choice, I'd have slept in at home... Lots of scary people in town
now.
MAIN: 
MS. TORIUMI: Those Apathy Syndrome rumors have been all over TV lately.
Same with those cult members... How did things end up this
way? Well, this is what they said about it on TV
yesterday... It's a "disease" born from modern society,
where the darkness in their hearts completely takes over.
They say it's inevitable in a hopeless society like ours,
and that its victims are victims of society. But I think
that's wrong. Everyone has darkness in their hearts, but
they fight against it, right? It's true that hope isn't
something you come across so easily in our society... But
that hardly gives them license to give up! They should be
able to stand on their own two feet! ...Anyway, that's
what I thought. I hope you were paying attention, class.
Something profound like that is bound to be on the final
exam.

now "Great"!

=== EVENING ===

JUNPEI: ...S'up, dude? Three more days, man. I believe in you. We should go to
Tartarus. ...We gotta be ready.

=== EVENING ===

MITSURU: Welcome back. The weather's still cold. ...How are you feeling? There
are only two days left, so you should rest if you need to. You don't
want to get sick now. ...Spring will soon be here.

=== EVENING ===

AIGIS: ...Greetings. Tomorrow... The promised day... It's been ten years since
"Death" has awakened... Once we enter Tartarus tomorrow, we won't be
able to leave. ...Are you ready?

=== EARLY MORNING ===

Tartarus. You suspect that once you enter Tartarus tonight, you won't be
able to leave until the battle is over.

=== EVENING ===

[The party is gathered in the meeting room.]
MITSURU: Alright... This will probably be the last time we meet like this.
...Is everyone ready?
YUKARI: ...U-Um, can I say something?
[She stands up.]
YUKARI: I know that we have to defeat Nyx... But if you think about it, that
means we'll be getting rid of the Dark Hour... So our memories may
disappear... But, even if that happens... I want you all to know, I
won't forget you! Even if it robs us of all of our memories together...
I will still remember you all!
JUNPEI: We know you will, Yuka-tan!
FUUKA: I won't forget you, either!
KEN: Neither will I!
AIGIS: I will not forget you, Yukari-san.
MITSURU: Don't worry, even if you do forget about us, I'll remind you.
AKIHIKO: ...Yeah, so don't worry about it.
YUKARI: Oh, I'm so glad to hear that...
[Junpei stands up too.]
JUNPEI: Okay! Then, after the battle, no matter what happens, let's promise to
meet each other again!
KEN: Good idea! But, where should we meet?
FUUKA: I don't think it should be the dorm... We'll come back here anyways if
all goes well... Hey, shouldn't we also decide on when we'll meet?
AKIHIKO: Yeah, it should be a special day...
YUKARI: What about Graduation Day? When the Dark Hour vanishes, our memories
might not disappear right away. So we shouldn't plan to meet too soon
after the battle. And there's no day that will have more significance
to us all.
KEN: Wow... You're really smart, Yukari-san! Graduation Day...! Yes, that will
be easy to remember.
JUNPEI: Yeah, that's probably our best bet... Graduation Day it is! Now, where
should we meet?
MITSURU: It should be somewhere where it's easy to recogniza that peace has
returned to the city. And when we meet again... we should remember how
we're feeling right now... That no matter what may happen, we will
never look back...
YUKARI: ...I agree.
[Everyone nods.]
KOROMARU: Arf!
MITSURU: Sorry, but you'll just have to wait! Alright then, let's get
going.
MAIN: 
[Main stands up.]
YUKARI: Yeah...
FUUKA: ...Together.
AIGIS: ...I will do my best.
JUNPEI: Good, cuz I'm counting on ya!
AKIHIKO: ...This is going to be easy.
MITSURU: ...Yes it is.

=== DARK HOUR - JIN ===

[The party reaches the 258th floor, where they encounter Jin.]
JIN: So, you came after all...
AKIHIKO: You...!? Where's your partner?
JIN: Takaya went on ahead of me. He's destined for greater things. So, it looks
like you're serious about fighting Nyx.
FUUKA: How do you know about Nyx...?
JIN: I pieced together the information Ikutsuki left behind. But, not all of it
made sense... He was a real nut job.
YUKARI: Did you know Ikutsuki?
JIN: We were surprised to find out he was your boss. We really only knew his
name... He was just one of the researchers who created us.
MITSURU: He "created" you!?
FUUKA: Who are you!?
JIN: Heh... There's no use in telling you... The end is near.
MITSURU: We don't have time for this... Get out of our way.
JIN: Can't do that, little lady... There's no way you'll be able to stop Nyx...
But, I can't let you interfere with Takaya's wish.
YUKARI: Do you even understand what you're saying!? If Nyx isn't stopped, all
life will be destroyed!
JIN: Exactly. We won't live much longer... and we want to see the end before
we die. That is Takaya's wish... so I'm not backing down. Enough talk.
Let's do this.
[The party begins fighting Jin.]
JIN: This is it... I ain't holdin' back!
JIN: I've improved since our last fight! You can't hide your weaknesses from
me!
[Jin takes some damage.]
JIN: Tch, you think you're tough? I won't lose this time!
[Jin takes a lot of damage.]
JIN: No... I ain't finished yet! Come on!
[Jin reaches critical condition.]
JIN: Dammit...!
[The party defeats Jin.]
JIN: Ugh... I failed... Ngh...
[He drops to his knees.]
JIN: What're you waiting for...? Finish me off! I would do anything for
Takaya...
AKIHIKO: Why are you so loyal to him?
JIN: Heh... You wouldn't understand... Takaya showed me the light when I was in
the darkness...
[Jin sits down.]
JIN: It was a long time ago... In order to better understand the Dark Hour...
Kirijo rounded up kids that were living on the streets, and gave them
special powers... so they could investigate Tartarus.
MITSURU: What...?
JIN: But, when that power doesn't emerge naturally, it's difficult to control.
So the kids had to take experimental medication so their powers wouldn't
kill them. Only three kids out of the original hundred survived, and after
6 months, the experiment was cancelled.
FUUKA: Then, those three were...
MITSURU: You all suffered at the hands of Kirijo...
JIN: Takaya saved me from it all... He said, "Don't let the past control you,
and don't look to the future; simply live in the moment..." To be honest,
I don't even care about Kirijo anymore. But, Takaya's wish... must be...
fulfilled...!
YUKARI: You..
[Suddenly, several Shadows appear around the area.]
AKIHIKO: Tch! We were here too long!
MITSURU: We're running out of time! We have to go! Now!
JUNPEI: But... We can't...
JIN: You idiots! I don't want your pity...!
[Mitsuru turns to look at him before running ahead; the rest of the party
follows behind her. The Shadows begin to converge around Jin.]
JIN: Heh... I won't let you eat me... I believe in you, Takaya... Fulfill your
wish... I will hold on the freedom you gave me to the very end...!
[As the Shadows close in, Jin pulls out a grenade and throws it onto the
ground. The party feels the explosion from the stairs.]
JUNPEI: Hey... was that...? Did he...!?
MITSURU: ...... Let's go.

=== DARK HOUR - TAKAYA ===

[The party reaches the 262nd floor, where Takaya is sitting off to one side.]
AKIHIKO: Is the top of Tartarus past here?
TAKAYA: Indeed.
AKIHIKO: Then, let us through.
TAKAYA: I am not standing in your way.
[Takaya stands up.]
TAKAYA: I take it you have defeated Jin... You are quite troublesome. What is
it that you seek? These are your final moments... The end is nigh.
AKIHIKO: Sorry... But, we're not gonna let that happen!
TAKAYA: You are merely wasting your energy... Why not celebrate this wonderful
moment? What better way could you spend your final moments together?
YUKARI: Will you shut up already!?
TAKAYA: My life was stolen from me... And in its place, I was given a power I
never asked for... And so, I learned that the future is only a
delusion. Only by striving to live every moment to its fullest can the
soul be truly satisfied. That is why we welcome this glorious
revelation, to shine a light upon this darkened world!
JUNPEI: You're so full of shit! I'm not dying so you can have a friggin'
night-light!
TAKAYA: This is not merely my desire. There are many who have also gathered to
rejoice in her arrival.
FUUKA: That's just because all these weird things have been happening...!
TAKATA: That is untrue... Who is responsible for reviving Nyx? Can a single
person boast of this great accomplishment? You all worked tirelessly to
prevent it, and yet in doing so, you unwittingly aided in her coming...
So you see, this is not just my will; it is the will of all people.
Man cannot face death without first finding meaning in life... But the
world has realized that any meaning in life was lost long ago... Nyx
has come because humanity has cried out for her salvation!
FUUKA: That can't be...!
KEN: I-I don't believe you!
AIGIS: And yet, there is truth in what he says...
YUKARI: Aigis...
AIGIS: But, now we know that it was a mistake... And that's why we're here.
It's not a matter of whether it is possible or not... It's a matter of
believing in ourselves. That's what it means to "live".
MITSURU: The world isn't so simple that one person can decide whether we all
live or we all die... So, even if there is no hope, we won't give up.
TAKAYA: ......
[Takaya walks out in front of them.]
TAKAYA: Hmph. What do you know of this world? No matter how long you search or
how hard you pray, eventually you will realize that there is no truth.
Just as death is eternal, a truth that has been lost can never be found
again. Are you really so desperate to die that you will stand before
the almighty Nyx!? Such foolishness is what I am trying to rid this
world of.
[He pulls out his revolver.]
TAKAYA: If you insist on asserting your way of living, then I shall do the
same! The coming of Nyx is but moments away!  Ahahahahahahahah!!
[The party begins fighting Takaya.]
TAKAYA: You needn't hurry. The moment we await is predestined. It's only a
matter of time.
FUKA: Please be careful! I sense even greater power than
before...!
[Takaya takes some damage.]
TAKAYA: Even as I speak, I can feel it. The end of everything... I pity those
who cannot see it for what it truly is... a blessing.
[Takaya takes a lot of damage.]
TAKAYA: We are mere mortals; we cannot change our fate. You would be foolish
to deny it...
[Takaya reaches critical condition.]
TAKAYA: Ha... Hahaha... It seems we are destined to be in opposition... How can
you summon such power... even in the face of death...?
[The party defeat Takaya. He lies weakly on the floor.]
TAKAYA: I have failed... haven't I...?
AKIHIKO: ......
TAKAYA: There is nothing more I can do... Now... kill me.
AIGIS: ...Are you scared?
TAKAYA: ...What a peculiar question. You know nothing of death, if you think
that it is something to fear...
AIGIS: What do you mean?
TAKAYA: You fear it because you do not understand it... I will not explain to
you any further.
MITSURU: There's no honor in taking the life of someone who can't move. You
will live to see if what you wished for comes true or not.
JUNPEI: Yeah, lie there and repent for what you've done.
TAKAYA: You are all so odd...
MITSURU: We're finally here... Up ahead is the top of Tartarus... The promised
place Ryoji spoke of. ...Let's regroup for the final battle.

=== DARK HOUR - NYX AVATAR ===

[The party emerges onto the roof of Tartarus. Dark clouds are billowing all
around.]
MITSURU: We finally reached the top.
YUKARI: Hey, look at the sky!
[EVeryone looks up.]
FUUKA: Something's coming!
AKIHIKO: Is it Nyx!?
FUUKA: I can sense it even without my Persona. This is the first time that's
ever happened...
[A large winged creature descends to the tower. Upon getting close, they can
see that it's face resembles Ryoji.]
AIGIS: You are...
YUKARI: Ryoji-kun...!?
NYX AVATAR: That was my name for a time... I didn't mind it.
MITSURU: ...What's going on? Wait, are you...?
NYX AVATAR: I am merely a harbinger of the Fall... Although, Nyx and myself are
now one in the same.
AKIHIKO: Is that so...? Well regardless, I don't regret my decision. I'll
defeat you, no matter what you are!
NYX AVATAR: I see... Then, you must already know. What people fear most...
What they try to ignore... That is what I am.
KEN: We know that already.
AKIHIKO: Yeah. ...Everyone does.
MITSURU: You are what awaits all living things from the moment they are born...
NYX AVATAR: Then, you also understand that it's pointless to resist... So, why
do you? ...There must be fear in your hearts.
JUNPEI: Yeah, of course I'm scared... But, it's no use carrying on about it!
I wanna live!
YUKARI: ...I'm tired of running! Living means looking death square in the
face... So, I won't back down... not even from you!
AIGIS: I will stop you, even if it costs me my life. That is my own decision!
NYX AVATAR: ...I see.
FUUKA: Everyone, get ready! Nyx is preparing to attack!
[Fuuka turns around.]
FUUKA: I'm sensing Shadows approaching from below, too!
MITSURU: Everyone who's not fighting Nyx should try to keep them at bay! This
is our last chance... We can't afford to lose!
[The party begins fighting Nyx Avatar. They deal a significant amount of
damage.]
NYX AVATAR: The moment man devoured the fruit of knowledge, he sealed his
fate... Entrusting his future to the cards, man clings to a dim
hope. Yes, the Arcana is the means by which all is revealed...
Attaining one's dream requires a stern will and unfailing
determination.
[Nyx Avatar summons an image of the Fool Card that quickly changes to the
Magician card.]
FUUKA: Nyx's Arcana changed to the Magician!? Be careful!
Its properties have changed!
[As the party fights him, Nyx Avatar continues to shuffle through the Arcana.]
NYX AVATAR: The Arcana is the means by which all is revealed...
The silent voice within one's heart whispers the most profound
wisdom.
FUUKA: It changed properties again. If you need me to analyze
it, just say the word.
NYX AVATAR: The Arcana is the means by which all is revealed...
Celebrate life's grandeur... its brilliance... its magnificence...
NYX AVATAR: The Arcana is the means by which all is revealed...
Only courage in the face of doubt can lead one to the answer...
NYX AVATAR: The Arcana is the means by which all is revealed...
It is indeed a precious gift to understand the forces that guide
onself...
NYX AVATAR: The Arcana is the means by which all is revealed...
There is both joy and wonder in coming to understand another...
NYX AVATAR: The Arcana is the means by which all is revealed...
One of life's greatest blessings is the freedom to pursue one's
goals.
NYX AVATAR: The Arcana is the means by which all is revealed...
To find the one true path, one must seek guidance amidst
uncertainty...
NYX AVATAR: The Arcana is the means by which all is revealed...
It requires great courage to look at oneself honestly, and forge
one's own path...
NYX AVATAR: The Arcana is the means by which all is revealed...
Alongside time exists fate, the bearer of cruelty.
NYX AVATAR: The Arcana is the means by which all is revealed...
Only with strength can one endure suffering and torment.
NYX AVATAR: The Arcana is the means by which all is revealed...
In the face of disaster lies opportunity for renewal.
[Eventually, the party manages to defeat all the Arcana through Hanged Man.]
NYX AVATAR: The moment man devoured the fruit of knowledge, he sealed his
fate... Entrusting his future to the cards, man clings to a dim
hope. Yet, the Arcana is the means by which all is revealed...
Beyond the beaten path lies the absolute end. It matters not who
you are... Death awaits you.
[Nyx Avatar shifts his Aracana to Death.]
FUUKA: I sense... Death! Nyx's true Arcana is Death!
[The party deals some damage to this last form.]
NYX AVATAR: You cannot avoid death. To live is to die; they are one in the
same...
[Nyx Avatar casts the Moonless Gown spell, causing a barrier to appear in front
of him.]
FUUKA: W-Wait! Something's strange about Nyx... I have a bad
feeling about this... It's definitely up to something! Have everyone
hold their attacks! It's too dangerous right now!
[After a while, the barrier disappears. The party deals more damage to Nyx
Avatar.]
NYX AVATAR: Let us finish this. It is the path of your choosing.
[Nyx Avatar uses the Night Queen spell. Even so, after a long battle, the party
manages to defeat him and he slumps to the ground.]

=== DARK HOUR - NYX ===

[Nyx AVatar is motionless.]
MITSURU: ...Did we do it!?
[Suddenly Nyx Avatar stirs, and slowly begins to levitate back up into the
sky.]
NYX AVATAR: Such a pity... You understand fate, yet you still fight against it
with all of your will... If more people were like you, then perhaps
the Fall could have been prevented... but it's too late now.
[As Nyx Avatar continues to rise, the moon opens up to reveal a large entity
within.]
FUUKA: The moon!
YUKARI: what is that!?
[Nyx Avatar sends a beam up into the moon.]
AKIHIKO: This... This can't be real!
AIGIS: Soon... Soon it will descend upon us... upon us all...
[The coffins across the city disappear and the population begins to panic.]
MAN: Huh, what the...? I was...
MAN: What the hell is going on here!?
[A cultist looks up at the moon.]
CULTIST: Look at the moon, it's glorious! The end of the world, it's really
here, everything they said was true!
[Suddenly his head shatters into goo. The scene shifts back to the party.]
[As the party continues to gaze up in awe, Takaya stumbles in behind them.]
TAKAYA: At last...
[He drops to the floor on his back.]
TAKAYA: Ha... Hahaha... Hahahahaha!
KEN: You...!
TAKAYA: Vexing, isn't it? The look on your face is priceless!
AKIHIKO: Shut up...!
YUKARI: But, what're we gonna do!?
FUUKA: ...!? Something's coming!
[The moon shoots out a wave of energy that hits the party, and they struggle
to remain standing.]
KEN: What is this...?
YUKARI: This is... nothing...
TAKAYA: How ridiculous... Are you out of your mind?
JUNPEI: Look who's talking!
TAKAYA: Death is imminent... Surely you know this... What do you hope to
accomplish now? I wanted to see the end wth my own eyes... Jin...
[He passes out.]
AIGIS: I will never give up! Never!
[Nyx Avatar is continuing to feed the beam into the moon.]
NYX AVATAR: Why resist that which is inevitable? You will only suffer...
JUNPEI: Dammit, I won't back down!
YUKARI: I've made up my mind... I'll fight to the end!
JUNPEI: Aaahhh!
[Everyone manages to get back to their feet. The moon sends out another wave.
Ken falls back down.]
AKIHIKO: Ken!
[Aigis and Junpei collapse as well.]
JUNPEI: Son of a...!
MITSURU: We've come this far! I will not submit!
[Akihiko and Mitsuru also fall. Main closes his eyes.]
[Many of the friends the party has met are shown at Naganaki Shrine. Natsuki
runs into the area.]
NATSUKI: Okay, gotta stay calm... just like Fuuka was when she saved me... I'm
the one who said we'll always be connected... That's how I know
you're still hanging in there, Fuuka. I'm scared as hell right now...
but I won't give up! Right, Fuuka!?
[The scene for entering the Velvet Room replays.]
IGOR: There's no need to worry. This isn't the afterlife... You're still
alive. Do you remember what I once told you...? ...How the strength of
your Social Links will determine your potential?
[Igor holds a hand to his ear.]
IGOR: Listen... Can you hear the many voices? Each one's power is limited...
Yet, they all reach out to you... Can you feel them?
MAIN: 
IGOR: Close your eyes and listen carefully... Their voices may be faint, but
certainly you hear them...
[Igor holds up his arms and summons a large mass of enerygy.]
friends and loved ones are flowing into your heart...
(If you have a Social Link maxed, the respective person will have a line to
say here. Note that Maya's picture is a sillouette of Ms. Toriumi.)
KENJI: I'll always have your back, Main. All I can do right now is
pray... But, whatever it is, man... I know you can do it.
BUNKICHI: Something frightful's going on... but we won't give up.
MITSUKO: That's right, dear... Main-chan wouldn't want us to lose
hope...
KAZUSHI: Something crazy's going on here... but I know you're out there
doing all you can, Main... So, I won't lose my cool, either.
You taught me that.
MAYA: Oh god, this can't be happening! I wish I could talk to him, and
calm myself down... I don't even know what he looks like, but I
hope he's okay... He has to be... I can feel it.
KEISUKE: Main-kun... I know you're trying to stay focused... You were
there when I needed you... I hope I can do the same...
MAIKO: Everyone else is scared, but not me... You showed me how to be
tough! I won't give up.
BEBE: Main-sama... 'ow are you doing? I 'ope you are okay... I am 'ere
for you... like you were zere for me!
PRESIDENT TANAKA: What on earth made me think of you at a time like
this...? Well, I suppose you did teach me a thing or
two about loyalty...
MUTATSU: You must be fightin' the good fight right about now... Well,
you taught me that runnin' away never solves nothin'... so I'm
here for ya, kid.
MAMORU: I'll take on any challenge that comes my way, without
complaining about it... You taught me that, Main... I bet
you're fighting right now too, huh...
NOZOMI: You saved me, Main... I was so blind before... I'm sure you've
got things under control, right? You always do.
AKINARI: I know I'm not the only one who's suffered... You've endured
a lot, too... But, you can't just give up... You taught me
that.
IGOR: Can you hear them? These are the voices of hope that wish to help you...
Seperately, they are weak... But together, they will bring about a great
change in you. Now is the time to draw on the true strength of the bonds
you have forged!
[The energy mass transforms into a card that descends down to the table.]
IGOR: I never dreamed of seeing that card with my own eyes... This is indeed a
surprise... Behold the last power you and I shall unveil... It is the
power to bring about a new beginning, or the ultimate end. It may be
possible now, with this newfound power... You may be able to defeat the
one who cannot be defeated. What you have in your hands is the power of
the Universe... Nothing is outside the realm of possibility for you now.
[The card vanishes.]
ELIZABETH: We will soon reach your destination.
IGOR: It seems that, in addition to Death, fate has also dealt you the wild
card. ...You must accept your destiny. Our contract has been fulfilled...
I have completed my role as well. ...You were truly a remarkable guest.
[The room suddenly reaches the top floor, and the back wall opens up. Main
wakes up back in reality and easily stands up. He then begins to float upwards
toward the entity in the moon.]
AKIHIKO: What the!?
AIGIS: No, don't go!
[The others try to stop him but cannot manage to stand up.]
YUKARI: What is he doing?
JUNPEI: Dammit, why the hell can't I stand up?
YUKARI: Why, after all we've been through... Stop, don't do this! Come back!!
[Upon entering the moon, Main finds an egg-like object, which is the real Nyx.
He begins fighting it. It uses Death on him, which should kill him, but he
manages to live through it. Main hears the voices of his friends.]
KEN: There's nothing we can do!?
AKIHIKO: Don't give up! We have to believe in him!
MITSURU: Give him strength! Take my life if you must!
[Energy appears and restores some of Main's health. Nyx uses Death on Main
again, but this time it misses.]
YUKARI: Yeah, I'm willing to risk mine too!
FUUKA: He's going to face it all by himelf!
JUNPEI: No, he's not alone! I won't let him die!
[More energy appears and heals Main. Nyx tries to use Death again; this time it
has no effect on Main.]
KOROMARU: 
AIGIS: I won't allow this world to be destroyed!
SHINJIRO: Alright, let's do this...
[Even more energy appears, restoring Main's health to full. He uses the Great
Seal ability on Nyx, releasing a bright light. The scene shifts to the rest of
the party, who appear to be standing in space.]
YUKARI: Where are we...?
MITSURU: Did Nyx create this place? ...Or, was it him?
AKIHIKO: Is he alright, Fuuka!? What happened!?
FUUKA: Everything was engulfed by a bright light... I don't sense him.
KEN: Don't tell me he...
JUNPEI: No! That can't be! Try again! He can't be the only one...!
[Fuuka shakes her head.]
JUNPEI: You gotta be kidding me...
AKIHIKO: Dammit... Not again...!
MITSURU: We all decided to put our lives on the line... In fact, we came here
knowing we would most likely die.
AIGIS: How could I be so powerless...? This is what I was trying to prevent!
YUKARI: You're there, aren't you!? I know you are! I refuse to believe that
you're gone! Answer me! I know you can hear me!
AIGIS: We're here! Please let us hear your voice!
MAIN: 
[Everyone looks up.]
AIGIS: ...?!
YUKARI: ...!?
FAMILIAR VOICE: ...Don't worry.
[The voice sound like Ryoji.]
AKIHIKO: That voice...!?
FAMILIAR VOICE: I will sleep once again. Normal days will return to this
universe, for you... and for him.
YUKARI: ...!
FAMILIAR VOICE: He's found the answer to life's greatest question. It just
happened a bit sooner than it will for the rest of you.
AIGIS: Life's greatest question...
FAMILIAR VOICE: Aigis... You'll find the answer one day as well. You, too, are
a precious living thing... You just need to realize how the
bonds of friendship have changed you... The Dark Hour will soon
vanish from this world... All will truly be reliquished from
its dominion, and the legacy of life will continue.
Congratulations, you have the miracle you sought. We shall meet
again some day...
[The party reappears at the foot of Tartarus. The tower suddenly breaks apart
and disintigrates into the night. Main appears before them, and Aigis begins
crying. The sky returns to normal, with the Dark Hour gone forever.]
unexpected miracle, the world was saved from the Fall. Peace was restored,
and people resumed their busy lives. No one remembered anything about the
extraordinary turn of events. And so, the season changed... ...... One month
later...

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main arrives at school. Junpei runs up behind him.]
JUNPEI: Yo! Damn, it's cold. But of course, you never miss a day of school.
Man, can ya believe this year's already over? We're practically seniors
now. Just one more year... Ya think anything interesting will happen?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: I hope you're right. But, seeing the current seniors makes me
wonder...
JUNPEI: Well, seeing the current seniors makes me wonder...
JUNPEI: Seems like all they frickin' do is study. Talk about boring. Is that
gonna be us next year? ...Why do I feel like I'm forgetting something?
[Junpei shakes his head and they walk forward. They spot Aigis next to a tree.]
JUNPEI: Hey, is that girl looking at us? Dude, she's pretty cute! How come I
never noticed her before?
[Yukari walks up to them from behind.]
YUKARI: What are you talking about? She lives in the same dorm as us.
JUNPEI: Seriously!? Uh... What's her name, then?
YUKARI: I dunno.
JUNPEI: So then, why're you giving me a hard time? Anyway, it's always crazy in
the dorms this time of year, with so many people coming and going. Oh
yeah, did ya hear? Akihiko-senpai's movin' out. Ya know, the Captain of
the boxing team?
YUKARI: I know who he is, but I haven't really talked to him. Of course, all
the graduates are leaving, even Kirijo-senpai.
JUNPEI: Ms. Student Council President... She's in our dorm too, huh?
[They turn to look back at Aigis. Yukari waves.]
YUKARI: Hey, there! Are you looking at us? Is something wrong?
STRANGE GIRL: Um... It's nothing.
[Aigis runs away.]
JUNPEI: She looks kinda depressed, doesn't she? ...Wait, do ya think she might
be interested in one of us!?
YUKARI: Haha, I doubt it.
JUNPEI: ...Ouch. That hurts.
[They continue to walk forward. Junpei stops again.]
JUNPEI: By the way, Yuka-tan... Uh... Never mind. Forget it.
YUKARI: Aw, come on now... Don't gimme that.
JUNPEI: Um, well... Do you remember how we became friends? I mean, don't take
it the wrong way. I was just thinking...
YUKARI: Well, it's not like we're best friends or anything, so I guess it just
kinda happened.
JUNPEI: Yeah, I guess so.
YUKARI: ...It IS kinda weird, actually, now that I think about it. But, I can't
really explain why. Anyway, that girl--
[The first bell rings.]
JUNPEI: Oh crap!
[The three of them run to class.]

=== EVENING ===

must be enjoying the peaceful evening... ...... Even though you've just
returned from school... you are feeling very tired. You should go to sleep
early tonight.

=== EVENING ===

rest... Tomorrow is Senior Graduation Day.

=== EARLY MORNING ===

[Main is in his room sitting at his deak. There's a knock at the door.]
AIGIS: It's me, Aigis. May I please come in?
MAIN: 
AIGIS: But... I...!
[Main opens the door and Aigis walks in.]
AIGIS: Thank goodness. I'm so happy to see you again... I'm sorry to show up so
suddenly... But... I really needed to talk to you.
MAIN: 
AIGIS: ...I remember everything. Everyone seems to have forgotton, but I
remember... That day, we...
MAIN: 
AIGIS: I'm sorry... It's just that, when I remembered... I was afraid you might
go somewhere far away, like you did at the last battle...
MAIN: 
AIGIS: Graduation's today, isn't it? I'm sorry... The ceremony's already
begun... Such nice weather outside... Do you remember? ...The promise
we all made? Why don't we go there and wait for the others...? We can
enjoy the view of this peaceful city...

=== MORNING ===

[The Graduation Ceremony is taking place in the auditorium.]
CLASS REPRESENTATIVE: ...The time to part has finally come. Though this is our
last day together, we want the senior class to know that
you've truly earned our respect. We wish each of you good
health, happiness, and prosperity. On this auspicious
occasion, I bid you all a fond farewell on behalf of the
student body.
[The student bows and walks offstage.]
TEACHER: Next, a word from the valedictorian... From Class D, Mitsuru Kirijo.
MITSURU: Thank you.
[Mitsuru walks onstage to the podium.]
MITSURU: This last year, I accepted an important responsibility as Student
Council President. When I first addressed you from this podium, I
spoke to you all about seizing opportunity while you had the chance...
Well, it must have been fate that intervened and gave me an important
reminder of this... As many of you may know, my father unexpectedly...
[She pauses for a moment.]
MITSURU: He unexpectedly passed away, due to sudden illness...
[She pauses again, and holds a hand to her head.]
MITSURU: Sudden illness...?
GRADUATING SENIOR: Wow, that's rare. I've never heard her stumble in a speech
before.
Graduating Senior's Friend: It's a big day... It must be tough thinking about
her father.
[Mitsuru slowly resumes her speech.]
MITSURU: I remember... Yes... With my father's death, I lost my purpose in
life...
YUKARI: Hang on, wasn't I supposed to...?
[Akihiko gets up behind Junpei and pulls him to his feet.]
JUNPEI: Akihiko-senpai, what's up?
[Fuuka and Yukari get up too.]
MITSURU: But now I have something to live for. No longer will I run from the
future! I will face it head on, carrying out my father's will! I am
resolved and without reservation.
[The others begin to gather in the aisle.]
JUNPEI: The promise!
[They begin walking toward the stage.]
MITSURU: I owe it all to my invaluable friends... And we have promised to never
lose hope, no matter what tomorrow may bring.
[Mitsuru leaps from the stage, knocking over the microphone and raising an
uproar in the crowd.]
YUKARI: Senpai, we made a promise. Let's find him, and Aigis too!
MITSURU: Yes, I can hardly wait. Everyone, let's go!
[They all run out the door.]
[Main and Aigis are on the rooftop. Main's head is lying in Aigis's lap.]
AIGIS: The wind feels so nice... This is my first time experiencing spring.
But, this season will eventually pass... After fighting alongside you,
and facing the world's end... I finally began to understand... what it
means to live... Thinking for yourself... Not running away... Accepting
the inevitable... All things eventually come to an end... Every living
thing will one day disappear... Only by accepting this can one discover
what they truly want... What the meaning of their life will be... I
understand now why I was so tormented by my lack of strength. Protecting
others became more than just an order I had to obey. I wanted to do it
for my own reasons... I realized this once I decided to try and prevent
the Fall. When I thought I might never see you again, something else
became clear to me--what I wanted most. And so, I made up my mind. I
decided that I would continue to protect you. I want to be your
strength. I know I'm not the only one who can do this... but that's
okay. My life will be worth living if it's for this reason... Thank
you...
MAIN: 
[Main raises a hand to Aigis's face, and she takes it.]
AIGIS: You're right. What am I doing? I understand now, so I should be happy...
JUNPEI: Heyyy!!
AIGIS: Everyone... I realize now that I have friends as well. You don't have
to save the world to find meaning in life... Sometimes, all you need is
something simple, like someone to take care of. I'll keep on living no
matter what, so that I can protect you...
AIGIS: Thank you for everything... You must be tired... Please get some rest...
I'll stay right here with you...
AIGIS: Soon, all your friends will be here by your side...
MAIN: 
[The butterfly from the opening flutters by as Main falls asleep on Aigis's
lap. Aigis doens't have her earpiece on on, and her eyes are watery.]
AIGIS: Don't worry. I will always be by your side, protecting you...
[The scene fades to white.]
[The credits roll as a montage of anime scenes flash by. Afterwards, the others
arrive on the rooftop to find Main and Aigis, and Aigis smiles at them. The
word Fin appears in the corner before the picture fades out. The player is
prompted to save for a new game cycle, and then the game goes back to the
title screen.]
Optional/NPC dialog

=== SCHOOL LOBBY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: Huh? The Faculty Office? Um... I think it's that way. Actually,
I'm new here, so you should probably ask someone else.
FEMALE STUDENT: Oh, great... I have the worst teacher ever...
MALE STUDET: There's no need for them to post the names of the kids who are
gonna be in our class... I mean, we'll never see them again after
we graduate anyways.
MALE STUDENT: Whaaaaaat? I don't see my name... What should I do...? What
should I do...?
VENDOR: Hm? You seem interested in what we've got on sale... You must be a new
student! I don't have enough bread for everyone, so if you want some,
come early. I don't have any customers once school's out, so I can't
sell that much.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: You really shouldn't be outside on your own at night. It's too
dangerous. Anyway, you must be tired. You should get a good night's
rest.
YUKARI : Oh, hi. What're you doing?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: ...Oh.
YUKARI: Well, there's not much to see...
YUKARI: Just killing time, doing nothing...
YUKARI: You're probably pretty tired, huh? Maybe you should go to bed
early tonight.
YUKARI : You're probably pretty tired, huh? Maybe you should go
to bed early tonight.
NEWSCASTER: --it's a trend that just might spread all over town. Our
next story is about the cherry blossoms. It's springtime,
and they're all over town now. The blossoms this year were
a little late compared to other years, but they'll be at
their peak this week.
MITSURU: We cannot allow you to go out after dark. Sorry, but rules are
rules.

could you come back later?
MALE VOICE: All right, that's enough. I said, come back
later.

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR, DARK HOUR ===

YUKARI: What should I do?
YUKARI: Y-You can't go down there! I'm sure they have it under
control...
YUKARI: This isn't a training exercise, you know... If we don't get
out of here, we're going to die!
YUKARI: Let's get out of here... Please...!
[The ground shakes again.]
YUKARI: I-It doesn't seem like it's going to be over soon...
Downstairs... They're fine, right?
YUKARI: We could hide in this room... N-No... That wouldn't work after
all...
YUKARI: Mm, this won't work... If we stay here, we'll...

=== TARTARUS LOBBY, 1ST VISIT ===

MITSURU: Don't worry. I won't push you too hard. You'll be just fine.
AKIHIKO: Since Yukari and Junpei have no real experiance in battle, make sure
you back them up.
YUKARI: So, this is Tartarus...
JUNPEI: Alright, let's do this! I'll prove that I should be in charge...
MITSURU: Do you mind not touching that? I use it to transport delicate
equipment necessary for gathering information.

JUNPEI: Dude, that's the wrong way...
YUKARI: What are you doing? There's nothing over there. C'mon, let's
go.

=== TARTARUS, 2ND FLOOR ===

MITSURU: I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to leave
this floor today. It's important that you gain experience in
battle, first. Now, see if you can eliminate all the Shadows
wandering around on this floor.
MITSURU: The goal today is to gain experience in
battle! Running away is not an option. Return immediately and
eliminate the Shadows!
MITSURU: You're in charge... what are you waiting for?
Issue the order to split up.
HELP: PRESS THE SQUARE BUTTON TO ISSUE ORDERS TO YOUR ALLIES.
MITSURU: Good, you found the Access Point. Please return to the
entrance.

=== TARTARUS LOBBY, RETURN VISIT ===

MITSURU: From now on, you'll select your party here, before you enter Tartarus.
I'll explain the details some other time. Tres bien! You did well
today. Now, let's head back to the dorm.
AKIHIKO: You guys did a great job, but you won't have to shoulder the burden
forever... Tch! If only I hadn't gotten injured...
JUNPEI: Dude, I can't take it anymore... I'm starving...
YUKARI: I'm feeling tired... Let's go back...
MITSURU: That's enough for today. You have plenty of fighting ahead of
you. Let's return to the dorm.

=== JUNPEI ===

JUNPEI: He said Paulownia Mall, right? I wonder what's up...
JUNPEI: Dude, is Akihiko-senpai blind, or just plain dumb? Those chicks
were all over him! Man, I'm so jealous...
JUNPEI: The police station...? There aren't any ladies there!
Whatever. Let's just get it over with.

=== SCHOOL GATE ===

GIRLFRIEND: I'm waiting for my boyfriend... We're going to Hagakure.
CURIOUS STUDENT: Every school has a strange building that no one knows what
it's used for. There's one here, you know... I'll tell you
about it later...
STALKER GIRL: 
STALKED BOY: ...I have this strange feeling that someone's watching me.
JUNPEI: ...Hey! We've gotta get to the Police Station!

=== OFFICE HALL ===

TEACHER: There's a saying, "He who hunts two hares at once
will catch neither." That means a student like you who's always trying
to do two things at once will...
MALE STUDENT: He sounds like he knows what he's saying, doesn't he? Well,
listen to this... Last year, he was dating two women at the same
time. But, the thing is, they worked together! And when they
found out, they both dumped him!

=== CLUBS HALL ===

FEMALE STUDENT: There are lots of classrooms here... But you knew that.
Cell-phone Student: What do you want? I'm using my cell now. Talk to me later,
okay?

=== CORRIDOR ===

FEMALE STUDENT: That tree seems special for some reason... I wonder why it's
there... Does it commemorate something?

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: School's barely started, and there's already been a student who
quit. She only had two years left... What'll she do if she
doesn't graduate from high school?
FEMALE STUDENT: She said she's going to quit being a high-schooler. Well, it's
her life, not mine.
MITSURU ADMIRER: When you were absent, there was an election for Student
Council President. Mitsuru-senpai's speech was sooo cool! I
voted for her! Everyone else looks so small compared to
Mitsuru-senpai.  Mitsuru-senpai...
COMPLAINING GIRL: My parents always nag me to like, study for exams and stuff.
They're so annoying! I just became a junior--I'm supposed to
be having fun! They just came into some money, so they're
getting all strict about my future and junk.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: Dude, Mitsuru-senpai's speech this morning was crazy. I heard no one
was even close to her in the election. Considering her background, I
don't know why they bothered. Let's face it, we're all just plain
ordinary compared to her, man.
FEMALE STUDENT: Do you tend to get lost in school?
MAIN: 
FEMALE STUDENT: Where are you headed?
MAIN: 
FEMALE STUDENT: Leave this room and go down the stairs
to the right. Then, go through the
double doors on your right-hand side
and head straight.
FEMALE STUDENT: Leave this room and go down the stairs
to the right. The Art Room, Music Room,
and Science Room will be right there.
FEMALE STUDENT: It's located right across the hall from
this room.
FEMALE STUDENT: Leave this room and go down the stairs
to the left. While facing the shoe
cupboard, go right to enter the hallway
where the Office is located.
FAT STUDENT: It must suck to transfer to a new school. You have to relearn the
whole system.
MALE STUDENT: Hey, new guy... Whaddya think of the girls here compared to your
old school?
MAIN: 
MALE STUDENT: I knew it. Our school has tons of hot chicks.
MALE STUDENT: So, your old school had lots of hot chicks too?
MALE STUDENT: Are you serious!? Is that even possible!?
MALE STUDENT: I hear that, starting on the 23rd, some new athletic teams will
be recruiting new members... Just the Track Team, Kendo Team, and
Swim Team, though. The others are full. If you're interested in
joining, why don't you go check it out? Go down the stairs to the
right and you'll eventually find it.
Student in Warm-up Suit: Dude, another gorgeous day! I should go for a jog
before practice!

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

Short-haired Housewife: Oh my! How did I forget to buy shampoo!?
HOUSEWIFE WITH BRAIDS: No rush. Just wait for the sale. Isn't Saturday
the sale day of Aohige Pharmacy?
SNOOPY REPORTER: Hello, young man. Say... Have you heard anything about this
business of ordinary, healthy people changing overnight?
MAIN: 
SNOOPY REPORTER: Well, obviously. It's all over TV.
SNOOPY REPORTER: Hey! You don't sound concerned at all! How can
you not know about this? You live here!
OLD MAN: Everywhere you look, you see young couples. So what're you waiting
for? Go after someone! You're still young. You've got no excuse not to
be together with some girl.
GAMER STUDENT: This is my first time coming to an arcade by myself. Hmm...
What should I play...?
BE BLUE V SALESWOMAN: Heheheh. Our accessories are great! People who use them
say they feel more powerful, and lighter on their feet.
OFFICER KUROSAWA: I usually patrol at night, so I won't be here during that
time. You should come here after school or on the weekend.
PHARMACY SHOPKEEPER: The competition between different pharmacies is heating
up. I've got to make my stock more unique, or I'll be
sunk. I'm starting by making Saturday a regular sale day.
Come out this weekend and support my store!
JUNPEI: Dude, this place doesn't open until later...
JUNPEI: You wanna have a cup of tea? Well, too bad! We gotta go to the
police station!
JUNPEI: Dude! The police station's next door!
JUNPEI: Dude, you passed the police station! Turn left!
JUNPEI: Dude, we can check it out AFTER we go to the police station.
But, there's no way I'm doing a duet with you!
it will reopen on June 9th.
JUNPEI: Oh, it's not open, huh... Wait a minute! This isn't the police
station!
JUNPEI: Let's go to the police station first, man...
JUNPEI: We can come back later, right? Let's go to the police station
first.
JUNPEI: Alright, alright! But, after the police station, okay!?

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

STATION ATTENDENT: The best part of this station is its size, and how close it
is to the ocean. We're proud of it. I personally like it a
lot... What about you?
MAIN: 
STATION ATTENDENT: Wonderful! I'm glad you like it.
STATION ATTENDENT: Well, the more often you come here, the more
it'll grow on you.
STATION ATTENDENT: I see... I'm a little disappointed to hear
you don't grasp the beauty of this station.
Movie-Loving Man: Do you like movies?
MAIN: [I love movies.]
Movie-Loving Man: Me, too! Movies kick ass! I love them because
they're like a microcosm of real life.
[I don't like movies.]
Movie-Loving Man: Man, that's sad... You're going to regret not
seeing lots of movies, later in life.
LAZY STUDENT: Man, school has started... I'm so lazy. Why? Listen, I don't need
a reason to be lazy. Besides, everyone gets like this after days
off. It's the truth, man.
NERVOUS MAN: Th-The weather is nice today...
PATIENT WOMAN: Yeah. It is, isn't it?
JUNPEI: Dude, that's NOT the police station...
(Try to go to the Mah-jong Club or the Bar before meeting Akihiko at
PAULOWNIA: )
JUNPEI: Dude, if you go in there, you might end up at the police
station in handcuffs! ...Man, I'd never go down there if I
could help it.
JUNPEI: What if there are gangsters in there, man!? Let's get outta
here before we get shot!

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

MATURE GIRL: I have a new teacher, but... He's, um... We're already a little
into the first term, and it still feels weird to be in the same
room with him.
MAIN: 
MATURE GIRL: It's like, he doesn't talk at all, even during
lunchtime.
MATURE GIRL: How should I know? We never talk. When I say
hello, he just smiles.
MATURE GIRL: I'm a sixth grader! I'll be moving on next year, and I'm
stuck with a teacher like this...
TAXI DRIVER: I envy you students. It's a new term, for you guys. But for
cabbies like me... it's the same thing, year in, year out.
MAIN: 
TAXI DRIVER: Yeah... Every season, I pick up the guys who miss
the last train. My fares are kids twice as young
as me, and then... spring is over.
TAXI DRIVER: I'm not feeling bad or nothin', just... I feel
like I've done it all before, you know? Every
year...
SALARYMAN: As you can see, I'm just a salaryman. I'm not just skipping work.
Cat-Obsessed Boy: My friend has a cat, and it's sooo cute! I want one too, but
my mom hates animals...

JUNPEI: You know this is not the Police Station, right? We're supposed
to go to Paulownia Mall! Not here!
JUNPEI: Damn, that smells good. I wanna go buy some, right now! ...But
I'm not falling for it! Not even delicious takoyaki can stop us
from getting to the police station!
JUNPEI: Dude, this place is so bad for you, but sometimes I just get a
craving. ...Hey, what about Paulownia Mall?
JUNPEI: Oh yeah, we better eat before we go to the police station,
huh... Wait a minute! That's not as important!
JUNPEI: I heard the ramen here kicks ass. Wanna try it? ...Hang on.
We gotta get to Paulownia Mall since Akihiko-senpai is waiting.
JUNPEI: Dude, guys going to the sweet shop together? Are you kidding
me? ...Wait a minute, we need to go to Paulownia Mall! Not
here!
JUNPEI: Are you dumb or what? How many times do I have to tell you...?
WE GOTTA GET TO THE POLICE STATION!
JUNPEI: Dude, what manga is so amazing that you have to buy it right
now? Forget it. We have to get to the police station.

=== FRONT OF DORM ===

JUNPEI: You didn't forget about going to the Police Station, right?

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: You did very well for your first night in Tartarus. Tell me,
what did you think about it?
MAIN: 
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Yes, I understand. It is difficult to avoid
the fatigue one experiences during the Dark
Hour. And battling enemies while you explore
the tower can be quite tiresome. However, in
time, I think you will be able to adapt to its
rigors.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Yes, I agree. That tends to be one's first
impression when experiencing the mysterious
tower.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Why, that's absolutely remarkable! Would you
like to apply to become the next chairman?
AKIHIKO: Officer Kurosawa doesn't have the potential to enter the Dark Hour;
he's just an ordinary policeman. But, he knows about us and helps us
out when he can.
MAIN: 
AKIHIKO: To be honest, I don't really know. But, he's a police
officer, so he's dedicated his life to helping people.
Plus, he's a pretty cool guy.
AKIHIKO: You bet. The police station is the only place we can
buy equipment.
AKIHIKO: Well, Kurosawa-san usually patrols at night... so you
won't be able to buy equipment during those times.
AKIHIKO: He helped me out a while ago. He's someone you can
count on.
MITSURU: Those who are unable to experience the Dark Hour are Transmogrified
during that time... They appear as coffins. Shadows are quite
enigmatic... They only attack those who have not been Transmogrified.
Shadows feed on the minds of their victims, leaving them unable to
speak. We call this Apathy Syndrome. And those who suffer from this
incapacitating affliction are known as... The Lost.
YUKARI: I get pretty tired after we go to Tartarus. I feel like I spent all
day hiking up Mount Fuji. What about you, Main-kun?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Yeah, I think we just have to get used to it.
YUKARI: Really? You don't look like you have that much
endurance.
JUNPEI: Hey, ya know that thing we use to summon our Personas... the Evoker?
Well, I was thinking, why does it have to look like a gun? I mean, you
gotta be a little nutty to point a gun at your head and pull the
trigger, ya know?
NEWSCASTER: --there has been no further information. Investigators are
facing a difficult case, since there were no witnesses.
This is the 12th instance of the mysterious incident. A
team of investigators is working hard to track down any
leads.

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

FORTUNE TELLER : Hmm... I feel a strange aura around you... In my
mind, I see visions... People's past, present, and
future... For most people, I see clearly, and far
ahead... But you are different... Your future is
filled with both blinding light and stagnant
shadow... I can see but a small portion... What lies
beyond that is shrouded in mystery... What a
peculiar fate you carry... Now, young man... Bearer
of light and shadow... If you wish to know more
about the near future... come and talk to me... I
will share my limited visions with you... Now, tell
me... Would you like to know your fortune?
MAIN: 
FORTUNE TELLER: Very well... You have pulled fate's trigger...
The bullet passes through many, heading
directly to it's target... What target that may
be, however, is unknown to me... You must find
that out for yourself... Farewell, then... May
your future be bright...
[No thanks.]
FORTUNE TELLER: Come back any time...
FORTUNE TELLER: Would you like to know your fortune?
MAIN: 
FORTUNE TELLER: Very well... You have pulled fate's trigger...
The bullet passes through many, heading
directly to it's target... What target that may
be, however, is unknown to me... You must find
that out for yourself... Farewell, then... May
your future be bright...
FORTUNE TELLER: Come back any time...
WOMAN: Hmmm? Hey, you're pretty cute for a newcomer. This club is pretty nice,
huh? I come here sometimes, too.
MAN: Nothing's happening nowadays... I guess that's what peace means. How about
you? Anything happening in your life?
MAIN: 
MAN: I see... Sounds tough. Well, good luck with whatever it
is!
MAN: Didn't I say so? See, nothing really is happening...
Fortune-loving Girl: Do you believe in fortune-telling?
MAIN: 
Fortune-loving Girl: So you do too? I don't mean to say it
comes true all the time, but sometimes...
Fortune-loving Girl: Hmm...
Fortune-loving Girl: You should take it more seriously. I don't
mean to say it comes true all the time,
but sometimes...
Girl's Friend: I've known that girl since we were in elementary school
together. She loves fortune-telling stuff. She used to pull out
these weird props from her bag... She claimed they were her
lucky charms.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: If an enemy dodges when you attack with a close-range weapon such as
a sword, there is a possibilty you may falter. However, continuous
attacks with a sword will inflict a great amount of damage.
Contrarily, there is no danger of stumbling when you use a far-range
weapon such as a bow. However, a bow is nowhere near as powerful as a
sword. I see that you can use both types of weapons. It is important
to think about these advantages and disadvantages when choosing
between the two.
AKIHIKO: If you get knocked down when you're tired, it'll be hard to get back
up. And if you don't get up fast enough, you'll become the enemy's
main target.
YUKARI: My Persona seems to be good at healing, using skills like Dia. I'm not
wearing a nurse's uniform, but you can come to me if ya need healing!
JUNPEI: Yeah, right... A nurse's uniform...
YUKARI: What, is that funny?
JUNPEI: You need to be hot to pull off a nurse's uniform, and you're
definitely----NOT.
YUKARI: Why you little--!
JUNPEI: Damn, dude... You can use so many different types of weapons. Everyone
else can only use one type of weapon. For me, it's the two-handed
sword. That's because real men fight with katanas! With a katana you
can sometimes hit an enemy over and over... and it's super strong!
Consider me the main attacker of the team! I'm one baaad mutha!
Although, sometimes I fall down when an enemy dodges my attack... but
don't worry about that.
NEWSCASTER: --who was then immediately sent to the hospital. The man
has regained consciousness, but due to his condition, has
been unable to speak. Police are awaiting the man's
recovery before questioning him. And that's the news for
today.

=== CLUBS HALL ===

FEMALE STUDENT: By the way, the sign on the door to home economics looks
like it was written in another language. It's hard to read...
It doesn't look like English... And if you listen close, you
can hear mysterious voices inside... It's one awfully
mysterious home economics class, let me tell you.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: This may sound like a weird question, but do you think it's possible to
do well in Tartarus AND in school?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Wow, you're pretty confident. Why don't you prove
it...?
JUNPEI: Well, at least we agree on one thing.
JUNPEI: Me!? I think you know the answer to that...
STUDENT WITH GLASSESS: Greetings and salutations... How can I be of assistance?
Since you're a transfer student, you're probably
unfamiliar with the Bay Area.
HELP: WHEN YOU SPEAK WITH THIS STUDENT, THE CITY MAP WILL BE DISPLAYED.
SELECT A LOCATION, AND YOU WILL RESUME PLAY FROM THERE.
STUDENT WITH GLASSES: Would you like to know what popular desinations
are in the Bay Area?
MAIN: 

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

WOMAN: Uh... Uhh... Uhhhhhh... Uh...
such a stir. You cannot get a meaningful response out of this person.
GAMER STUDENT: Hey... Those weird people... That's those, what do they call
them...? The mysterious victims. They're so creepy...

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

Movie-loving Man: That girl sitting next to the vending machine... She looks
so sad, doesn't she? I get sad, too, after I've paid for a
crappy movie, but... Not like that. They're just nuts. Is
this what people keep talking about? That Apathy Syndrome...?

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

AKIHIKO: I'm so bored after school because I can't do any training. By the way,
have you joined any clubs?
MAIN: 
AKIHIKO: Good, I hope you enjoy it. It's tough to attend all
the time, but you'll really get a lot out of it if
you do.
AKIHIKO: There may be some clubs you can't join until you meet
their qualifications. There aren't that many clubs
here, so you should try to check them all out.
MITSURU: When exploring Tartarus, it is important to monitor the status of your
teammates, as well as your own. Teammates who are sick or tired should
not be permitted to explore the tower.
JUNPEI: Your Persona is like a part of you... That's why mine only learns
physical skills ...Because dudes are supposed to fight with their
fists! Mano a mano! Oh, that's right... I use a sword.
YUKARI: Well, I prefer a bow and arrow, probably because I'm in the archery
club. What's great about a bow is you don't fall down if an enemy
dodges one of your arrows. Although... a bow doesn't do very much
damage, and it misses a lot... But, you can always balance those
negatives with your Persona. So, no worries.
NEWSCASTER: --the customers sure were excited to see her like that. Our
next story is about the release of the spring carp. Over
10,000 were released into the river this year. The next
carp-release ceremony will be held in June.

=== SCHOOL LOBBY ===

STALKER GIRL: He's sooo hot... Um, why am I telling you this? Well,
whatever... You have to admit, he IS a hottie...
STALKED BOY: Dude... I think that chick's checking me out... Oh yeah, dude,
she's DEFINATELY checking me out...

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: I heard that student who quit school stays at home all the
time now. If she'd at least kept her name in the school roster,
she might have been able to graduate, but...
FEMALE STUDENT: I wonder if she's become a shut-in this year because she had
to go through a lot as a first-year? Well, it's her life. I
don't care.
COMPLAINING GIRL: Uniforms are so boring. I wish someone would make, like,
casual uniforms. Yeah, like that'll happen...

=== CLASS 2-F ===

KENJI : Hey, Main... Yukari-san's pretty hot. I bet she has really
high standards... She probably won't even look at a guy
unless he's really good-looking. ...Well, it doesn't
matter to me, anyway. I'm not really interested in her.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

OLD MAN: You know the coffee shop, right? That fancy looking one, Chagall.
The shop next door is going to be opening this month. I've got a bad
feeling about that place, but if you want someone to talk to, maybe
you should go.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

NERVOUS MAN: Hmmm... The conversation ended so soon...
PATIENT WOMAN: He looks like an interesting guy, but he's a really bad
conversationalist. I'm a little worried about him, since this
is the time of year to make new friends.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

SALARYMAN: Ahh, I love the outdoors. Breathing the fresh air, walking around
on foot... It's healthy. You can even get a bite to eat at the cafe,
or the burger place. I love coming here... Even if it means skipping
work.
SNOOPY REPORTER: A perfectly healthy person becoming mentally ill overnight...
There's no family history of it, and they haven't been in any
terrible accidents. There wasn't even any similarity to the
last victims. It was a different time, in a different place.
This is one tough mystery, you know that? But I'm gonna solve
it. I WILL solve it.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

AKIHIKO: If you're around people who are sick, you might get infected by them.
Hmm... I wonder why you don't notice you've been infected until after
the battle... Must be because you're concentrating so hard on
fighting... Well, anyway, just don't come near me if you get sick.
JUNPEI: Yo, some weapons and pieces of armor have special effects. Equipping
one of them will affect your status, dude! I think only Persona-users
can use them, though.
YUKARI: Shadows have weaknesses, but so do we. Let me rephrase that...
WE don't have weaknesses, our Personas do. My Persona seems to be weak
against electricity, but strong against wind.  She'll probably
never learn any electricity skills...
NEWSCASTER: --despite this, they were able to safely finish the
concert. Our next story is about a strange animal from
overseas. It's called... the platypus. The platypus, an
animal native to Australia, is an egg-laying mammal. And
behind the male platypus' feet are poisonous spurs! What a
strange animal!

=== CLASS 2-F ===

FAT STUDENT: When you go to a new school, you have to worry about where you'll
sit, too. It would suck if you ended up in the front row.
STUDENT WITH GLASSES: Hey, have you become accustomed to the
Bay Area yet? There are many interesting places to go,
with or without friends. I love the aroma of coffee at
Paulownia Mall... and if you're feeling brave, you can
try the mystery burger at the local strip mall. The movie
theather changes flicks every month. I often go there
alone... Don't get me wrong. It's not that I don't have
any friends. Anyway, are you interested in popular

TAXI DRIVER: I couldn't hack it at my last job, since I'm kinda anti-social,
so I became a taxi driver. But... When my fares start a
conversation with me, I never know what to say to 'em.
KENJI: Hey, Main. I was just about to head home, but I don't really feel like
walking... Hey, that doesn't mean I'm looking for an unlocked bicycle,
alright?
Cat-Obsessed Boy: I played with my friend's cat at his house again.  I
want a cat, too... I know my mom hates animals, but maybe I
should ask her...
LAZY STUDENT: Everyone's making friends these days... I dunno. It seems like a
lot of work. I know there's an upside to having friends, but...
If I could just figure out a way to do it without all that
"bonding" stuff, y'know?

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

AKIHIKO: Sending everyone out on their own is a good way to explore a floor in
Tartarus. But, if you stumble across an enemy, you might have to fight
it by yourself. That can be pretty dangerous... But if you're strong
enough, the enemy will be afraid of you, so you won't have to worry.
NEWSCASTER: --with many people choosing to go overseas during the long

seems. Airports are filled with air travelers... According
to a population survey, the most popular destination is

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR ===

YUKARI: Mitsuru-senpai should be in the meeting room. She said she was gonna
do some training. Oh, but if you want to go to Tartarus, she said it
was alright.
JUNPEI: I'm too young to be this tired. It sucks even more when you get tired
in battle... When you're tired, you don't hit as hard, so it takes
longer to beat an enemy. Plus, you get hit more easily. "You youngin's
don't know what's good fer ya... Back in my day, we knew when ta rest!"
YUKARI: I understand your point, but what's with the corny
impersonation...?

=== DORM 4TH FLOOR MEETING ROOM ===

MITSURU: I'm training to enhance my ability to detect the enemy. It's the only
way we'll achieve our objective in Tartarus.

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

AKIHIKO: What's up? Are you going out?
MAIN: 
AKIHIKO: Yeah, go out and have some fun.
AKIHIKO: Hitting the books, huh?
AKIHIKO: I'm staying in today. I don't have anything I need to
do. Plus, I'm still injured.
MITSURU: Generally speaking, you may do whatever you like on your days off.
You can study or go out. It's up to you.
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Just be careful not to get injured.
MITSURU: Oh, I prefer to stay in and read.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

YUKARI: What a coincidence... Did you come here to shop too, Main-kun?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: This mall is pretty convenient. You can buy almost
anything here.
YUKARI: You don't know this place? You should explore the city
some more.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

STATION ATTENDANT: This station plaza has a modern design, and space for many
different stores. Please abide by the station rules, and
refrain from littering. I'm the one who has to clean it...

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

JUNPEI: Hey, Main! What's up?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Oh, okay. Well, you just got to this town, so...
Wandering around is good! You'll get to know the place
better.
JUNPEI: I just ate, man. All that exercise in Tartarus makes me
hungry.

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

MITSURU: Distressing an enemy without using skills is quite simple. All you
need to do is perform a surprise attack on it. However, if the enemy's
ability level is equal to yours, there is a lesser chance it will
become distressed.
AKIHIKO: A piece of equipment's attack and defensive properties are important,
but its special effect may be more important. Even if two pieces of
equipment are the same, if their special effects are different, then
their uses will be different as well. So if the properties on a piece
of equipment aren't very good, it might still be useful, depending on
what its special effect is.
YUKARI: For the tactic Heal/Support, all I have to do is heal and support,
right? Okay, then when you get hurt, I'll heal you with either an item
or a skill. But, there may be times when I won't be able to heal you.
So don't get mad at me if that happens.
JUNPEI: My Persona is strong against fire, man! It'll probably learn fire
abilities, too... I'm en fuego, baby! But, it's weak against wind...
I guess my flames get blown out by the breeze, huh...

GIRLFRIEND: I'm waiting for my boyfriend... We're going to the arcade today.
He's totally awesome at video games.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: Are you forgetful?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Then, make sure you don't forget to stock up.
Especially from Officer Kurosawa... I heard from
Akihiko-san that you can't buy anything from him at
night. If you wanna go on a school day, then go right
after school.
JUNPEI: Then, I won't nag you.
MALE STUDENT: Dude, there are some seriously hot chicks at this school...
Unfortunately, that means there will be fierce competition for
them. You better make your move early if you want a shot at one.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: As President of Student Council, I'm really quite busy. In fact, I
don't even have time to rest. I would be grateful if you could help
out sometime. Just stop by the Student Council Room when you have the
chance.
JUNPEI: Student Council, huh... Well, as exciting as THAT sounds... I think
I'll pass.
AKIHIKO: So, I heard Mitsuru asked you to join Student Council. Sorry if it
felt like you were forced to join... But any help you could give her
would be appreciated...
YUKARI: I don't really have time for Student Council. Every minute is either
spent studying, attending club, or fighting Shadows. Speaking of which,
you know about Mitsuru-senpai's-- Oh, never mind. Forget I said
anything.
NEWSCASTER: --today's exchange rate. The shifting economy has
strengthened the dollar against the yen. The current

=== OFFICE HALL ===

MITSURU: ... Are you heading home now?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: ...Sorry, I'm busy. I'm going to study for a while
before I go back. Make sure you don't neglect your own
studies. I know you have other things to worry about,
but studying should be a student's number one
priority.
MITSURU: Goodbye.

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

MITSURU ADMIRER: I heard you were invited to the student council. Mitsuru-
senpai said so...  I'm so jealous of you... I wish I
could get invited. You think I should talk to her or
something...?

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: How are your explorations of Tartarus proceeding?
MAIN: 
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Excellent. Then, continue the good work.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Well, don't worry yourself about it. Just aim
to continuously improve your skills.
AKIHIKO: If you use the tactic Stand By, then we'll stand by, no matter what.
You should probably use it when you're waiting for an analysis or when
you want to defeat an enemy. It's a pretty boring tactic, though, if
you ask me...
MITSURU: There are three advantages to knocking an enemy down. First, if all
your enemies have been knocked down, you can perform an All-Out Attack
on them. Second, an enemy that has been knocked down will be unable to
dodge an attack. Third, you can alter the attack order of an enemy
THAT IS DOWN. REMEMBER: in addition to attacking an enemy's weakness,
you should also know your next course of action.
JUNPEI: I heard a lot of gamers love Innocent Sin Online. Since tomorrow is a
holiday... You should play it, dude.
YUKARI: You know, it's pretty hard to heal you when you get sick... For
example, Dia is only half as effective on you. So try not to get sick,
'kay?
NEWSCASTER: --many of you are eagerly anticipating tomorrow. Due to
the Golden Week holiday, the highways are expected to be
jammed bumper-to-bumper. Traffic conditions are expected to
worsen from tomorrow until May 3. Officials expect the
roads to be cleared by May 4th. From all of us at Action
News, have a happy Golden Week!

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

AKIHIKO: A battle is a lot like a boxing match... Speed is crucial. Whether
you want to attack an enemy or dodge an enemy's attack, you'll need to
be quick.
MITSURU: The higher we advance up Tartarus, the stronger our enemies will
become. Are you well equipped?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: That's good to hear. Just don't get careless.
MITSURU: Officer Kurosawa sells equipment. You should go see
him when you have the time.
NEWSCASTER: --accident at the intersection. Over 6 miles of traffic is
backed up. Coming up next, more traffic reports. There
seems to be no problem at this section, but... the highway
in the other direction seems to be packed. Officials are
hoping the congestion will be relieved by May 4th.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL, DAYTIME ===

JUNPEI: I came to check out the weapons here. Man, don't they look great?
They've got that new weapon smell.
GAMER STUDENT: All right, I've made up my mind! I'm playing this crane game!
Now... Where do I start...?

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

MATURE GIRL: My teacher doesn't assign us homework. We're moving on to junior
high next year... I'm worried...
MAIN: 
MATURE GIRL: Really? You didn't get much homework when you were
in middle school? Maybe they're trying to relax
the students...? I hope I can at least graduate
from college...
MATURE GIRL: Yeah, there's a difference between taking it easy,
and goofing off. If he wants to be popular with
the students, he should just talk to them more
often.
MATURE GIRL: Is that how it goes? So I should wait until the
teacher changes his attitude...? That could take
forever.
YUKARI: It's almost May, but it's still chilly. Make sure you don't catch cold.
If you feel sick, or if you're tired, take a break.

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

JUNPEI: No one's back yet, and we have school in the morning. We probably
shouldn't go to Tartarus tonight.
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Okay, then I'm gonna hit the sack.
JUNPEI: Listen to me, man. We shouldn't go tonight. Besides,
it would be just you and me there. You know, like,
Brokeback Tartarus. ...So just forget about it.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL, EVENING ===

AKIHIKO: You'll see for yourself if you go to the police station, but
Kurosawa-san isn't there at night. So you can't buy weapons after
dark. I knew, but it slipped my mind, and I came out here to see if I
could check out the weapons anyway... So don't make the same mistake.

=== OFFICE HALL ===

STALKER GIRL: The first thing I do when I get to school is look for him... Just

I express my feelings for him...?
STALKED BOY: Do you see that girl over there? I think she's following me
around. Hmm... How should I deal with this?

FEMALE STUDENT: There's a science teacher who brews his coffee in the test

the side effects?
Cell-phone Student: Whaddya want? What, you've never seen a cell phone?
MAIN: 
Cell-phone Student: I thought so.
Cell-phone Student: I've never seen anyone who didn't know
what a cell phone was before.
Cell-phone Student: Well, I'm busy, so maybe I can explain it next
time.

YUKARI: Hey, Main-kun... Are you heading home? I thought you might want to
know, some of the athletic teams are recruiting new members... I think
it was the Kendo Team, Swim Team, and Track Team.

=== ROOFTOP ===

FAT STUDENT: Everyone I know is in a club, but... I just can't be bothered to
join one. They all say I'll make a lot of friends and all that,
but... I say whatever. I'm gonna do what I wanna do.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

NERVOUS MAN: Should I talk about the club...? No, that's no good... I already
did that...
PATIENT WOMAN: My boyfriend plays soccer at his college. I guess my taste in
men is pretty standard... He's not that good at soccer,
though. He's still a third-stringer. Don't you go to
Gekkoukan? Are you in any clubs?
MAIN: 
PATIENT WOMAN: Good luck, then.
PATIENT WOMAN: Well, it all depends on your personal taste.
You get to meet more people, though, if you
join a club.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

AKIHIKO: When all enemies have been knocked down, you can perform an All-Out
Attack. But, you can only do that when you're able to move. If you've
been knocked down, or have an ailment, you won't be able to do an
All-Out Attack. And remember, we can't do anything if our leader isn't
around.
MITSURU: The tactic that requires the most amount of strategic planning is
Assign Target. When you use it, you will need to assign a team member
to attack a particular enemy. By efficiently allocating the strength
of each member, you can fully utilize the collective power of the
team. If a targeted enemy has been defeated, the team member will
revert to his or her normal fighting style.
JUNPEI: In order to attack an enemy's weakness, we need to know what it is,
dude. And remember, if an enemy's been analyzed before, then we already
have its information. So, make sure you analyze our enemies so we can
kick their asses!
YUKARI: Even when my Persona grows, she doesn't seem to get physically
stronger. But, her skills seem to get more powerful... So just keep
that in mind.
NEWSCASTER: --cherry blossoms blooming near Aomori Castle. We here at
Action News recommend getting some fresh air and exercise
during Golden Week.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

PHARMACY SHOPKEEPER: People don't seem to get it... You can't become healthy
just by visiting the pharmacy all the time. You have to
eat a balanced diet, and exercise regularly. That's more
important than coming here. Kids tend to skip breakfast,
but if they do, they'll pay the price down the line.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: Akihiko is still having some tests done. He should be back tomorrow,
though.
JUNPEI: The tactic Act Freely lets us do whatever we want! So, don't worry.
Heal, support, attack... Whatever you need, we got your back! Huh?
Which enemy would we attack first? ...The one that's about to die, of
course! Listen, if you don't know what to do, just choose Act Freely.
YUKARI: Do you think that person who was in Akihiko-senpai's room is his
friend?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Akihiko-senpai said that guy goes to our school, but
I've never seen him there before...
YUKARI: Oh no? Then, I wonder how they know each other...
Akihiko-senpai said that guy goes to our school, but
I've never seen him there before...
YUKARI: Yeah, you're right. It's really none of my business,
anyway.

Right? I wish I could've seen it! I'd love to watch a real
boxing match!

SNOOPY REPORTER: Asking around is the basic technique to gathering information,
no matter how creepy the story is. So, how about it? Got any
info on the mysterious accident?
MAIN: 
SNOOPY REPORTER: I see... How disappointing. You've got a
mysterious aura about you, so I thought you
might know something about all this.
SNOOPY REPORTER: Can't you tell by looking at me? I'm a lady
journalist. I'm trying to bust this incident
wide open for the public.
SNOOPY REPORTER: ......
STATION ATTENDENT: There are lots of weird people out there now... I heard it's
the Apathy Syndrome victims, but... They keep walking in
front of the trains, and stop them from moving. I'd hate to
see one of them jump in front of a moving train...

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

TAXI DRIVER: The station workers always remind me to tell my customers to keep
the station clean. Seems like there's a lot of littering going on
these days... Eh, I shouldn't be saying anything.
MAIN: 
TAXI DRIVER: Nah, I ain't about to lecture my fares. If I did,
no one would wanna ride in my cab. And the
customer is always right, y'know? The station
people don't care about us either...
TAXI DRIVER: Yeah. What can you do, y'know? It's the rule from
the top... A regular cabbie's just gotta lump it.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: The amount of experience you gain will differ according to the number
of members who are in the battle. Therefore, fighting an enemy by
yourself will gain you the most experience. The more experience you
gain from fighting, the stronger you and your Persona will become.
AKIHIKO: The damage you do will be different, depending on which Persona you
use. Some Personas have skills, other Personas have physical
abilities. Remember, it's important to use a Persona that suits your
style.
JUNPEI: Hey, ya know how sometimes you feel great? Well, those are the best
times to go to Tartarus, dude. You'll definitely kick a lot of ass!
YUKARI: Hey, Golden Week starts tomorrow, so we'll have the next three days
off. But, then we have our midterms right after that, so...
NEWSCASTER: --today is the Hachiju Hachiya. The Hachiju Hachiya means
"88th Night." It marks the beginning of the late dew
season. It's widely known that this time of year is when
the best tea leaves are picked. The weather has been clear
with no fog, and the tea's flavor is excellent. There were
many tea parties thrown around town in celebration.

MITSURU: Akihiko's injuries will take longer to fully heal. Will you be able to
fight with only three members until he returns?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: C'est magnifique! Then, I'll be counting on you.
MITSURU: You should have more confidence in yourself. I know
you can do it.
AKIHIKO: Pay attention to the size of a Shadow. The bigger it is, the more
enemies there are inside it. And watch out for those red Shadows.
They're very powerful, so don't underestimate them. Know what you're
getting into before you attack one.
JUNPEI: What's up? You doing anything today?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: I'm sooo bored, dude. I can't believe that I don't
have anything to do during Golden Week.
JUNPEI: Damn you, you backstabber! Well, go ahead then. The
door's right there. Don't worry 'bout me. I'll just be
here, doing nothing.

Hmm. I wonder where she is...

companion will be a robot. Hmm... Perhaps I'll turn into a
robot too! Hahaha!
YUKARI: Oh yeah, about weapons... Different weapons have different uses. For
example... A one-handed sword isn't too hard to swing and it has decent
range.
JUNPEI: You know we can carry items, right? We use them when things get
dangerous. But once we use them all up, that's it, they're gone. So
don't get mad at me if I don't want to use an item, okay?

So, that's today down the drain. We're gonna try again tomorrow. I
always have the worst luck on my days off...

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR, EVENING ===

JUNPEI: Don't you sometimes wish you could know the order of action during a
battle? Well, lucky for you, I have an awesome way of finding this out.
HELP: WHEN YOU PRESS THE R1 BUTTON DURING A BATTLE, YOU CAN CHECK THE
ORDER OF ACTION FOR BOTH ENEMIES AND ALLIES.
JUNPEI: ...Tch, you already knew?
YUKARI: Knowing the order of action is key to winning a battle.
AKIHIKO: Yeah, a good example is when both sides are exhausted. If we
have the first attack and can expect to do a lot of damage,
then we should go on the offensive... If not, then it's
smarter not to attack and just focus on healing. Always
thinking two steps ahead when planning your battle strategy
will lead to victory.
AKIHIKO: Mitsuru? She's in the meeting room sharpening her special abilities.
But, if you want to go to Tartarus, you can go and tell her.

JUNPEI: Dude, how can you adapt so easily? Man, life must be a
piece of cake for you.
JUNPEI: I wonder how many days it is until summer vacation...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: The greatest advantage of a two-handed sword is its destructive
capability. However, you can't wield it very fast, so there is a high
risk of the enemy launching a preemptive attack. Therefore, when using
a two-handed sword, you must stand a good distance away from your
enemy, and pay close attention to the timing of your strike.
AKIHIKO: I get the urge to go to club when I'm at school. Should I just start
going to club when I feel like it, Main?
MAIN: 
AKIHIKO: Ha! Calm down. I was just kidding. Even if you said I
should, Mitsuru would never let me.
AKIHIKO: Hey, I was just kidding. Even if I wanted to, Mitsuru
would never let me.
YUKARI: Using a bow has its drawbacks... It has great range, but its attack
speed is slow. If a Shadow gets in too close... I'm done for. I need to
fight from a distance.
JUNPEI: You know that Tartarus is seperated into different areas, right?
...This is a perfect setup for me. "Now, who wants to reach the top,
hmmm?" "Oh, me! Me! I wanna go to the top! I wanna go to the top!"
Well? Whaddya think?

MAIN: 
MITSURU: C'est fantastique!
MITSURU: That's very true. I don't think you'll find a
dormitory like this anywhere else in the world.
MITSURU: That's an honest answer. But, I agree. This dormitory
can be quite tiring at times... However, we have a
very important task to accomplish. We will need you to
remain strong.
AKIHIKO: You can sell items, weapons, and armor. ...But that doesn't mean
anyone will want to buy anything from you. But, I guess there's
nothing you can do about that.
JUNPEI: Only Persona-users can see the special effect on a weapon or a piece of

Short-haired Housewife: My eldest is starting to be fashionable... I was
cleaning him room and found a ring. What I wonder is,
how'd he buy that on his allowance...?
HOUSWIFE WITH BRAIDS: He must have got it from Be Blue V. It's the
accessory shop next to the police station. My son
was telling me they have regular sales every
Sunday.
OLD MAN: This kind of place takes me back... Dance halls... We used to call
'em speakeasies! Those halls were packed with people... That's where I
stole my wife's heart--at the dance hall! I was one hep cat then...
OFFICER KUROSAWA: Some people with Apathy Syndrome have suddenly returned to
normal. I don't know how it happened, but it must've been
something you guys did. Thanks. I appreciate your hard work.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

STATION ATTENDANT: Even I don't understand what's going on here. Right at the
stroke of midnight, that train appeared right behind the
other one. Huh? You're glad there wasn't an accident? You
kids are so naive, I'm jealous... Because of this incident,
the company's stock went way down... And my salary went down
with it. If I ever find the culprit, I'm going to throw him
from the train into the ocean!
Movie-loving Man: All these new movies were released during Golden Week, but...
They all sucked! I'm sure everyone else who wasted their
money on those tukeys is saying the same thing.

TAXI DRIVER: I saw the news... That monorail, huh? Coulda been bad... I'm in
the same line of work, or near enough, so I got goosebumps as I

That's all she ever says.  I want a cat...

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: What a difficult mission! I cannot believe what happened to

there was some trouble on the monorail last night. But that's a
separate matter now, isn't it? Ahahaha...
AKIHIKO: Last night's battle must've been tiring. You should rest. Well, if you
want to go to Tartarus, then I'm not going to stop you. But if you do
go, just treat it as a light warm up.

JUNPEI: Dude, I was wondering what was up, but then I realized there's only
one week until exams. That's why everyone's been so quiet.
YUKARI: What's up, Main-kun? ...This morning, before I got on the monorail,
I took a look around. When I did, I realized how dangerous that night
was.
FEMALE STUDENT: Oh, you must be that new kid... Let me give you some advice...
Make sure you study hard for exams, since there will be some
tricky questions.
MALE STUDENT: I bet midterms will be easy. But, I'm gonna study just to be on
the safe side.
STUDENT WITH GLASSES: Hey, exams are coming up... I'm so excited. Why? Because
it gives me a chance to flaunt my knowledge. This time,
I'm gonna get the highest score in the entire 11th grade,
and impress Mitsuru-senpai... Um, please disregard that
last comment.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

GAMER STUDENT: Arcade games only start when you put in a coin, not like the
home consoles where you turn them on. I didn't realize how they

friends who help you out like that?
MAIN: 
GAMER STUDENT: That's cool. Be nice to them.
GAME STUDENT: You sure, man? I mean, what if you come up
against a problem you can't solve on your own?
No one's perfect... You should have friends who
can help, in case you get into a jam.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: The general public considers the monorail incident an accident caused
by human error. This could be quite damaging to the reputation of the
monorail company. Even though it was a Shadow that caused all the
trouble, I still feel sorry for them.
AKIHIKO: An enemy may be able to affect your status during a battle. So be
careful. If you get distressed, you won't be able to dodge, and your
defenses will go down. You'll also suffer a lot of damage. When this
happens, don't mistake it for an ailment.
YUKARI: The people on the monorail must've been pretty scared... It was so far
off course after the Dark Hour happened. I bet they had no idea what
happened to them.
JUNPEI: Shadows will come right at you when they see you. But, if you're
stronger than they are, they'll run away. And remember, even if you
don't have the first attack, you can still knock the enemy off balance.
...Did I just have a really evil look on my face? Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare ya.
NEWSCASTER: --mysterious Apathy Syndrome, but its victims are showing
signs of recovery. Family and friends are overjoyed that

=== SCHOOL LOBBY ===

KENJI: What's up, Main? You headin' home now? The exams aren't too far away, so
I'm goin' straight home today. Studying at the library is just too
boring... At home I can watch TV while I study.

=== OFFICE HALL ===

MITSURU: ... Exams are right around the corner... Have you been
studying? Remember, there's no shortcut to success... Persistance is
the key. Even if you study everyday, it takes time to see results.
You won't learn anything by cramming at the last minute. Why don't you
study at the library when you have the time?

=== CLUBS HALL ===

STALKER GIRL: I know I can't go on without talking to him, but... I think I
would be satisfied just to stare at him from afar...  What
should I do...?
STALKED BOY: You see that chick back there? I don't know what to do with her...
So I'll just leave her hanging.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

FEMALE STUDENT: I heard from some people who study in the library that they
don't get tired as easily. At home, there are more
distractions. The library is really quiet, so it's probably
easier to concentrate. Maybe you should give it a try. As for
me, my concentration is greater than anyone's, so I don't get
tired no matter where I study.
MALE STUDENT: If you can't concentrate at home, try going to the library. It's
right across from the office, and it's open most of the time.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: You need an extrememly high amount of concentration in order to summon
a Persona. So, if an enemy distresses you in battle, you won't be able
to use your Persona. Most intelligent enemies will try to use this
tactic... so please be aware of it.
JUNPEI: Yuka-tan went to borrow a notebook, huh? She must be serious about
studying for the exams... I guess I should study too... starting
tomorrow.

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: I heard there was a drive-by around here... They say the victim

FEMALE STUDENT: Did you hear about the girl who was kidnapped? She was just

done something...

=== CLASS 2-F ===

YUKARI: Hey, Main-kun, don't forget it's almost time for exams... Our senpai
are really smart, so we better get good scores, or they'll laugh at us.
Hm... Maybe I should study in the library. I get so tired when I study
late at night...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

AKIHIKO: Have you ever been enraged before? Well, there's a skill that can make
someone become enraged. It's a status ailment; anyone can go berserk.
Both your attack power and your attack speed will increase, but...
you won't be able to defend yourself, so you can get really messed up.
So if you become enraged, be careful...
JUNPEI: Weapons and armor can have special effects that will help you out in
battle. There are weapons that will increase your attack power, and
armor that will strengthen your defense. You can cover all kinds of
weaknesses this way. Just be sure you don't equip any weak weapons or
pieces or armor. It's all about the balance, man. Balance.
YUKARI: Some enemies can charm you. When you're charmed you will attack your
team members and heal your enemies. I wonder if I've ever been charmed
before. A person who's been charmed doesn't remember it happening...
NEWSCASTER: --who evidently left some gauze inside his patient's

NERVOUS MAN: H-How's your club going?
PATIENT WOMAN: Eh, not bad.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: In battle, an enemy may cause you to become extremely frightened. This
ailment is known as fear. Fear may immobilize you, or make you flee
from battle. When you are in this state, you will be unable to control
your own mind.
JUNPEI: What're you doin'? Studying?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Man, you're a good student. I'm not... I never study.
JUNPEI: Hey, don't lie. It's a proven fact that people who say
they don't study, secretly study their asses off.
NEWSCASTER: --today's exchange rate. The dollar is now valued at 114.9
yen, a slight increase from before.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: Shit, I just had a dream about the monorail... My exams were posted all
over the windows! They were all like 40% or 30%... Actually, that part
of the dream is realistic. Man, I can't escape exams even in my dreams.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

MITSURU: I'm sorry, but I must ask you not to go tonight or

using this time to study.
MITSURU: Very well. Spend tonight and tomorrow night studying

JUNPEI: Are you serious? You're such a strange guy.
AKIHIKO: It's disappointing that Fuuka can't join us. But don't worry, I'll be
back in no time. Or, did you want her to join instead of me?

Fuuka to join instead of me.

as she's a girl.

would be nice to have another girl in the dorm.
NEWSCASTER: --arrested a 22-year-old man who was selling illegal copies

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

AKIHIKO: There are times when an enemy will poison you... Every time you move
during battle, your stamina will decrease, and you'll remain poisoned
after the battle ends... So you should always have Dis-Poison on hand.
MITSURU: Ice and Electric skills don't only inflict damage... they can also
cause status ailments such as Freeze and Shock. If an enemy is weak
against either skill, it will have a greater chance of being stricken
with an ailment. Now, I don't think you'll ever use Zio to shock an
enemy, but I just thought you'd like to know.
YUKARI: The tactic Conserve SP means we shouldn't use SP during the battle,
right? Well, I guess I can still use my attack... and my physical
abilities... To heal, I could use items... Wow, you're really tying my

since I've been spending all my time studying. Oh, by the way, Mitsuru
won't be back until later... so we won't be going to Tartarus today.

in close to attack, so I hardly ever miss. But, my attack power isn't

JUNPEI: Dude, my Persona's getting stronger! It's really good at physical
attacks. But, its skills don't really change that much... Is that why
my grades are so low...?
YUKARI: Hey... I didn't know you had skills too...
JUNPEI: Haha... I was just joking...  Now I'm depressed...

AKIHIKO: Well, I wouldn't count on getting any appreciation from anyone, since

all over the school. I hope no one spreads any rumors about me.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

SNOOPY REPORTER: Another victim of those mysterious incidents was found at
Gekkoukan. Since the victim was at the front gate, that must
be the scene of the crime. After all, if the victim had been
elsewhere, and then carried to the front gate... Why would the
culprit do such a thing? The reasoning doesn't add up. Anyway,
there's a high probability that Gekkoukan itself is involved
in all this somehow...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Hmmm... It seems Yukari has a sixth sense when it comes to
Shadows. Actually, that's quite common. Dealing with Shadows
has a tendancy to enhance other... senses.
AKIHIKO: We're not going to Tartarus today. Mitsuru is training and Yukari has
a "weird" feeling... Tch, I wonder what that means...
NEWSCASTER: --if you're an Aquarius, then your lucky color is red. For
extra luck, try sticking your thumbs up all day long!

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR ===

YUKARI: Oh my god, Stupei! I can't sleep like this!
JUNPEI: I'd be happy to sleep with you, if it helps...
YUKARI: Maybe I should call the police, or better yet,
Mitsuru-senpai...
JUNPEI: Please... Anything but that!
JUNPEI: Yuka-tan's freakin' out, for no reason! All I said to her was that
someone might be in her room... or under her bed... or in her closet.
I mean, come on, that's nothing to get all worked up about, right?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Maybe Yuka-tan's just easily scared.
JUNPEI: Yeah, I guess you're right. All she'll probably see is
one of those big-ass cockroaches. ...Well, I guess that
would be pretty scary too.

=== DORM 4TH FLOOR MEETING ROOM ===

MITSURU: I'm sorry, but I'm in the middle of training my Persona to search for
enemies. The others appear to be busy as well... so let's postpone
going to Tartarus tonight.

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

AKIHIKO: You know about the computer behind the counter, right? The school
makes us send them updates on how things are going at the dorm. See,
that's what Mitsuru's doing right now.
MITSURU: This incident is quite bothersome. As President of Student Council,
I need to do something. It just isn't normal, but I have no idea
what's going on...
YUKARI: The victim was that girl who was bullying... It may just be a
coincidence, but something doesn't seem right about it. What do you
think, Main-kun?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Yeah, that's what I thought.
YUKARI: Hey... Don't scare me like that...
YUKARI: Sounds like Junpei brainwashed you... Tch,
he's such an idiot.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

Short-haired Housewife: Did you hear? That uh, what was it, the Apathy
Syndrome? There was a victim at Gekkoukan. He was
friends with my son's senpai.
HOUSEWIFE WITH BRAIDS: A victim in your own neighborhood? Oh my...
I guess we can't say it's none of our business
now. My son's teacher's relative's son's
calligraphy master caught Apathy Syndrome too.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

JUNPEI: Those two old ladies were talking about that case. Some people got
hurt, so you know word is gonna get out all over town about this one.

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

JUNPEI: Damn, rumors spread fast, especially this one. Everyone at school knows
about it... and soon everyone in town will too.
NARRATOR: On the next episode of Phoenix Ranger Featherman R!

Feather Swan!
NEWSCASTER: ...And now, the news.

=== SCHOOL LOBBY ===

VENDOR: Did you hear that one of the students fainted? Is she all right?
Hmmm... There's a lot of weird stuff going on out there. Watch out.

=== CLUBS HALL ===

Cell-phone Student: Three days in a row, we've had students at this school
passing out. It's a hell of a mystery. I'm itching to know
more... I should try looking into it.

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: They say a girl in classroom C fainted too... Apathy Syndrome
again, right? Phew... I'm glad it wasn't someone in my class...
FEMALE STUDENT: I told you! She just happened to faint in front of the gate!
Apathy Syndrome is so over-exaggerated! They'll get better if
you give them some time.
MITSURU ADMIRER: Everyone's talking about ghosts and whatnot... I guess they're
all really scared. I'm fine, though! If a ghost gave me
trouble, Mitsuru-senpai would cut it right in half! To see her
fight with a sword... I don't know if I could take it!
COMPLAINING GIRL: Everyone's talking about the ghost, and that kind of stuff...
I hate those kinds of jokes. Like how they say the ghost will
get you if you stay at school for too long... Um, I better
get going! See ya!

=== CLASS 2-F ===

MALE STUDENT: Ghosts can be creepy, but they don't have to be, right? If there
was a ghost that looked like a cute girl, I wouldn't mind being
haunted by it. ...As long as she doesn't devour my soul or
somethin'.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

GAMER STUDENT: Let's see... To start game, insert one coin... Control it using
the two buttons, and... What are you looking at? I'm not just
reading the directions, I'm carefully planning my moves.
OFFICER KUROSAWA: The number of people with Apathy Syndrome is increasing
again. I thought it would decrease, but I guess that was just
wishful thinking... The battle may be long and hard, but you
must continue to fight.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

YUKARI: I'm busy researching the ghost story online. So I'm going to pass on
Tartarus today.
MITSURU: Well, if Yukari isn't going, perhaps we shouldn't either. However,
there may be ghosts haunting the school...
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Hmm... This isn't good. So many inquires from parents and
reporters alike...
AKIHIKO: Yukari seems serious. Why? Well, just go check out what she's doing,
and you'll know right away.
NARRATOR: The sky is covered in dark clouds... For those who are
fighting, the light has not yet broken through.
NEWSCASTER: That was our special report. Coming up next, the news.

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

MAN: I heard a buncha stuff is happening out there. How about it? Is anything
happening out there with you?
MAIN: 
MAN: Oh, cool. Well, not here.
MAN: Me neither, man. I keep hearing about this stuff, but I
never get to see it. Is it all just a joke?

=== FRONT GATE ===

CURIOUS STUDENT: Hey, I read those ghost stories that were being spread around
school on the Internet. You know, the ones about those
students who died, became ghosts and ate humans... Wait, how
would anybody know they ate humans? There wouldn't be any
remains.

=== CORRIDOR ===

STALKER GIRL: Did you see that? He just threw a rock at a bird resting on that
branch! If he keeps that up, he might get possessed by evil
spirits... Though that's just a rumor, so maybe not.

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

MITSURU ADMIRER: Did you hear?
MAIN: 
MITSURU ADMIRER: Ah... Of course you would have heard. Any man
who hopes to get Mitsuru-senpai would have to
be as intelligent as she is.
MITSURU ADMIRER: Mitsuru-senpai would want a man who likes to
study. Maybe I should study more... If I
became the smartest in my class, she might
accept me, even though I'm a girl...
MITSURU ADMIRER: Whatever! A man like you has absolutely no
chance of getting together with Mitsuru-
senpai!
FEMALE STUDENT: I heard Fuuka-san fainted again, and she's taking days off from
school... I wonder if she's okay... She doesn't look very
strong.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

GAMER STUDENT: There are more of those people every day... They're so creepy.
Maybe I should go on home...

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

Movie-loving Man: You know those incidents where people turn into Apathy
Syndrome victims, right? Those guys look so weird... They're
all over town. If it was a sci-fi movie, they'd be zombies,
and if it was a suspense movie, it might be a virus... But
it's real life, and I have no idea what's happening.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

SALARYMAN: Gosh... Look at all those Apathy Syndrome guys... They're skipping
school and work, right? I wish I had Apathy Syndrome... Then I could
sit here all day long, just like them...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: It is difficult for me to believe that the incident was caused by
ghosts... However, there is still no explanation for it. So I believe
it's worth researching. Please let me know what you find out.
JUNPEI: I thought those stories were fake... But, she seems to be doing
research on them. Is it the power of the Junpei Zone?
YUKARI: Huh!? What did you just say!?
JUNPEI: Oh shit... I pissed her off...
YUKARI: Ugh... I wonder why I said that... Yeah, it's Junpei's fault...!
Everything's his fault...! The Junpei Zone!? Psh! You really are dumber
than you look!
AKIHIKO: Well, good luck. Even if we don't learn anything from it, it still
seems like fun research. I'll be looking forward to the results.
NEWSCASTER: A scandal sent an unfortunate company's stock prices
plummeting today... At the close of trading today, the
price per share had gone as low as 4,242 yen.

=== SCHOOL LOBBY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: That girl who collapsed is in my class... I heard she would run
away from home and spend the entire night outside. That's
probably why she ended up like that...
FEMALE STUDENT: One of the students who collapsed was in my sister's class
too... I guess she was running away from home as well. I heard
she always hung around the thugs at that "place"... Something
must've happened there.

=== CLUBS HALL ===

Cell-phone Student: I thought I could turn up some info, but I didn't find
anything at all. All three passed out, but they were in
different grades, and different classes. Different clubs,
too. So my investigation isn't going very well. Partly
because all their friends were those thugs... And I
obviously don't want to deal with them.

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: Y-You know how horror stories are popular now? I-I'm too afraid
to listen to them...
FEMALE STUDENT: ...If you're the last one left in the school buildings, you'll
hear a creepy PA announcement... A sobbing grandmother's voice
can be heard from the speakers... And if you don't leave the
school within 42 seconds... They'll find your corpse covered
in bright red blood!

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: Well, I guess we should do some digging. I wonder what people will
say... It's a ghost story, after all.
YUKARI: Oh, hi, Main-kun. Did you find out anything about the ghost story? I'm
gonna prove to everyone that it was just a rumor. ...And I'm not
scared, alright!?

=== ROOFTOP ===

FAT STUDENT: I can't understand why people are freaking out over those ghost
stories... I mean, running around school screaming and spreading
rumors... They all need to just grow up.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

AKIHIKO: My teacher told me this old saying: It's deafening when three women
are together. It's so true... These girls came up to me and started
talking about those rumors and... I got such a headache. Ugh, I can't
wait until those rumors go away.
YUKARI: Hey, did you do any research on that ghost story, Main-kun?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: I've heard so many different stories... I don't know
what's true and what's not. Maybe it's all a lie...
YUKARI: That's what I thought. You seem like you're too busy
to be bothered with ghost stories.
JUNPEI: Dude, there are rumors all over school. Don't people have anything
better to talk about? They're all just wasting their time.
NEWSCASTER: --rainy season is supposed to begin on the 10th. However,

We'll take another look at the Apathy Syndrome. There are
now over 70 cases, and...

=== FRONT GATE ===

CURIOUS STUDENT: I heard that those students who were sent to the hospital were
bulliying other students... Maybe it was their victims who did
that to them.

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: Fuuka-san is absent today, too.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

MATURE GIRL: My teacher told me there's been a lot of kidnappings these days.

MITSURU: How is your research progressing?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: C'est magnifique! Please keep up the good work.
MITSURU: Well, I can see why it would be difficult to ascertain
the truth. But, don't give up just yet.
AKIHIKO: Aren't you sick of hearing all those rumors?
MAIN: 
AKIHIKO: That's what I thought. Well, good luck with your
research.
AKIHIKO: You're pretty patient. Well, good luck with your
research.

=== FRONT GATE ===

CURIOUS STUDENT: You remember that ghost story about the angry spirit? Well,
I guess there's another version that's different from the one
I told you. Did ya know that?
MAIN: 
CURIOUS STUDENT: Well, I'd love to tell you it myself, but I'm
kinda shaky on the details. You know those
three girls that are always gossiping in the
hallway on the second floor...? I'm sure they
know the story inside and out.
CURIOUS STUDENT: I heard it's based on a real incident from 10
years ago... and they never figured out what
happened. Don't you think that makes the story
so much creepier?

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: Hey... If that story were true... Wouldn't someone have to die
every day? I mean, someone's got to be the last one left,
right?
FEMALE STUDENT: S-Stop... I don't want to hear any of that stuff!

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: I'm impressed that you've been able to gather so much information in
such a short amount of time.
AKIHIKO: I don't know what you guys are planning to do, but just don't overdo
it.
JUNPEI: I heard that there are meetings at that place a couple times a month...
All these thugs get together... It looks like a reunion for
ex-convicts. Hey, aren't we planning to go there tomorrow...? Shit...
We're in serious doo doo.
YUKARI: Alright, enough's enough. Tomorrow, I'm going to put a stop to that
stupid Junpei Zone thing. I hope you're not too freaked out, Main-kun.
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Good. I knew I could count on you.
YUKARI: Oh, put your purse down, Sally. I'm counting on you.
YUKARI: Oh, don't worry about that. He's always freaked out.

the outskirts of Port Island Station? Well, I accidentally
ended up there once. Dude, I was so scared I almost pissed

what I heard, they meet there a few times every month on
Saturday night. But, be careful if you go there, dude... That
place is dangerous. Real dangerous.

KAZUSHI: Since I have my warm-up suit on... maybe I should try and race the

YUKARI: Hey, Main-kun, don't forget about today, okay?
JUNPEI: Duuuuude, Yuka-tan is taking this WAY too seriously. Why did I open
my big mouth?

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: Yamagishi has disappeared... It began with a ghost story, and has
developed into a serious situation. We have to do something...
JUNPEI: I told you it wasn't a good idea to go there, dude. If Shinjiro-san
hadn't helped us, we'd be... Shit! I'm never going there again!
AKIHIKO: Are you out of your mind...? Tch, going to a place like that.
I mean, I'm proud of you guys for trying to gather information, but be
a little more careful next time.
YUKARI: That guy looked kinda scary, but he was actually really nice, don'tcha
think?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: But, I wonder what such a nice guy was doing in a place
like that...
YUKARI: But, he wouldn't have saved us if he wasn't a nice guy,
right? I just don't know why he's trying to act so

KEN: Nice to meet you. My name is Ken Amada. Are you friends with
Yukari-san and Junpei-san?
JUNPEI: Yep, you got it. He lives in the same dorm as me and Yuka-tan.
KEN: Really? I didn't know boys and girls could live in the same dorm.
YUKARI: Umm, uhh, well... It's like...
JUNPEI: We're exceptions! We've got good reasons for sticking close...
YUKARI: I talk to Ken-kun here a lot. He's a lot more reliable than Stupei.
JUNPEI: Geez, Yuka-tan, you're so mean... Besides, I'm way more mature than
Ken. Don't you think?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: See!? You hear that, Yuka-tan? Even Main thinks I'm
more mature than that kid!
JUNPEI: S-Serious!? Why you guys always gotta be harshin' the

advice is very useful.

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: I heard those people who fainted woke up. So... I guess that
means they didn't have Apathy Syndrome...?
FEMALE STUDENT: Remember what I told you? They just fainted because they were

ANTIQUES OWNER : ...Welcome. Officer Kurosawa told me about you and
your friends... I used to research Personas, so I'll
do what I can for you.
ANTIQUES ONWER : You don't have any jewels? You should really try to find
as many as you can. I may not be the only shop owner who
accepts jewels... However, I have the ability to detect
the true power of a jewel. Even if others consider one
of your jewels a useless rock, I may still need it for
its power. So, bring the jewels you find to me so we can
trade for the items you need.
OFFICER KUROSAWA: Those girls from your school who had Apathy Syndrome seem to
have regained your senses. ...Thanks to you and your friends
no doubt.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

STATION ATTENDANT: If you go down the side street, you'll come to a spot where
gangs gather. They always leave garbage behind, and spray
grafitti all over the walls. And every time, I'm the one who
has to clean it up. I'm going to catch those gangs someday
and make them clean it up themselves...
SALARYMAN: I heard about the disaster from someone I know who works at Gekkoukan
High.
MAIN: 
SALARYMAN: I think it's awful the way those students are
falling victim to Apathy Syndrome. It's probably
because of all the excess studying. Why would they
study so hard...? I hope they don't have delusions
of going to a famous university, and getting a
high-powered job...
SALARYMAN: Wow, I admire your bravery. That's the spirit!
Whatever happens around you, just don't give a damn
about it. An attitude like that will come in handy
once you enter adult society.

Cat-obsessed Boy: I asked my friend if his cat was really expensive. You know

annihilate Shadows...
YUKARI: Yeah, I'm sure that's what it is... Just ignore him... But
yeah, you should really check it out. Don't forget, it's
located inside Paulownia Mall.
JUNPEI: Mitsuru-senpai and Akihiko-senpai are both at the hospital checking up
on Fuuka... so we won't be going to Tartarus tonight.
NARRATOR: You have to be prepared, and carry an umbrella during the

Fortune-loving Girl: I had Mama tell my fortune, but it's true what they say...
Her fortunes aren't like the others. Everything that came
out of her mouth was so abstract... She never said

good fortune."
Girl's Friend: Her fortunes are abstract, but she's not trying to confuse you.
You're meant to interpret them, and decide how to act from

Mitsuru and Akihiko to walk Fuuka home. She shouldn't be
walking home alone.
YUKARI: It seems like Fuuka was forced to join us... Even though in the end it

JUNPEI: Dude, she's the exact opposite of Yuka-tan... Smart... Nice... Hey,
Main, whaddya think of her?

NEWSCASTER: It seems that there will be fewer June brides this year.
According to wedding planners, the number of June brides is

JUNPEI: Is Ekoda Fuuka's teacher? I just saw him, and man, he looks like the

AKIHIKO: Mitsuru and Yukari are on the 3rd floor, getting Fuuka's room ready
for her. They're cleaning it up. You know, dusting and mopping... They
said they'd call us if there are any cockroaches that need to be
killed.

MITSURU: I apologize for not being able to go to Tartarus two days in a row.
But, preparing for Yamagishi's move has taken longer than I expected.
So, that's that... As you can see, the girls' rooms are on this floor.
Males are not permitted.
YUKARI: That room is filthy, even though no one's living in there. Please

photography. You can observe any of them before joining.
They've got a different feel than the sports clubs, so think
hard before joining one. Like I just said, they start
recruiting on the 17th. Until then, you can beg all you want,
but they won't let you in.

YUKARI: I'm glad there won't be a full moon for a while... But, still...
I can't help thinking about it.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: Oh, Mr. Ekoda's punishment...? Well, there are some things in life
you don't want to know about... This is one of them.
FUUKA: Um, it's nice to see you again. They said I could move in on Sunday,
but I decided to come a little earlier. I wanted to begin helping you
all as soon as possible... But I didn't even have time to pack, so I
don't have anything with me.
AKIHIKO: Fuuka wasn't supposed to come here until Sunday afternoon, but she
really wanted to join us. I'm glad she wants to be part of the team.
I'm looking forward to the next mission.
YUKARI: I guess all that talk about Fuuka being sick wasn't true. At first,
people were saying that she was absent because she was being bullied...
But, then they started saying she was really sick. Strange, huh? She
seems pretty healthy to me.
FEMALE REPORTER: Hi, I'm Trish, with today's installment of "Who's
Who." Today's subject is a man in his 30s, with
sunglasses and long hair that reaches to his back.
When I asked what he did for a living he became upset.
Hmm... Why might that be...? ...Next is news. Pain,
pain, go away!

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

MITSURU: During Knock Down, we will focus on upending our enemies. We'll
concentrate on those enemies that are still standing and attempt to
exploit their weaknesses. If there are no enemies to fight, or if
there is no way to attack them, then we will stand by. We will be
unable to heal or support during this time. Please consider these
factors when you contemplate using Knock Down.
FUUKA: I finally moved all my things in. It's all my old stuff, but once I had
it all in my room, I felt revitalized. I'm still struggling a bit with
the layout, though...

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

SNOOPY REPORTER: I heard the victims from Gekkoukan are better now. But, I
still believe the culprit is somehow related to Gekkoukan.
That school is tied to all of this, I just know it. The key
is Gekkoukan's front gate. There must be something lurking
within Gekkoukan High...

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Fuuka is surprisingly adept at using technological devices.
And she is a very nice girl, always considering the feelings of
those around her. Her name suits her perfectly. "Fuu" means
wind, and "ka" means flower. She's like a flower gently blowing
in the-- U-Um, never mind... I-I'll stop talking now.
AKIHIKO: Our enemies seem to be getting stronger and stronger. You need to
train every day to keep pace with them.
JUNPEI: Fuuka will be supporting us...  She has the voice of an angel.
Don't get me wrong, Mitsuru-senpai has a nice voice too. It's just that
Fuuka's is just so calm and soothing.
NARRATOR: On the next episode of Phoenix Ranger Featherman R!

NEWSCASTER: ...And now, the news.

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

FORTUNE TELLER: Would you like to know your fortune?
MAIN: 
FORTUNE TELLER: Very well... It seems you have made another
friend... A late-night affair, unseen by all...
A bond made in the darkness, where the shadows
lurk... The result of this bond is too distant
to be seen... The only way to know how it will
end is to see for yourself... Farewell, then...
May your future be bright...
FORTUNE TELLER: Come back any time...

=== SPORTS HALL ===

STALKER GIRL: Did you notice...?
STALKED BOY: Hmm... This must be...
MAIN: 
STALKED BOY: To tell you the truth... Oh, forget it. It's private.

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

MITSURU ADMIRER: I wonder if Mitsuru-senpai is fluent in French... It would be
so cool if she is, with the way she looks and all... Just
imagining it gives me goosebumps! Or, as Mitsuru-senpai would
say, "la chair de poule."

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: Are you psyched, now that Fuuka joined the team?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Yeah, man, I'm totally stoked!
JUNPEI: Dude, why do you gotta take the fun out of everything?
You're gonna have a tough life if you keep this up.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

FUUKA: My Persona is called Lucia. She cannot enter into battle... Her job is
to support everyone on the front line with her ability to detect enemies
and provide enemy information. As for Lucia's attributes, her strength
and endurance are both low. She doesn't have any resistances, but she
doesn't have any weaknesses either. Well, that's all I can think of
for now. I look forward to fighting Shadows with you.
MITSURU: My weapon of choice is the one-handed sword. As you may be aware,
its attack power and accuracy level are only adequate... However, I
think it is tres magnifique! A one-handed sword is a refined,
sophisticated weapon. You should consider wielding one.
YUKARI: Mitsuru-senpai has moved from supporting us to fighting with us...
She can do anything... I'm so jealous...
WEATHER MAN: This week's forecast is sun all the way! There's only a
10-20% chance of rain. But be careful of dehydration, even
during the rainy season. It's going to be a scorcher!
Let's join our field reporter in the stadium now.
NEWSCASTER: Next on Action News: All the action in the world of sports!

COMPLAINING GIRL: I have a question for you... You don't look like the type to
care, but are you particular about the style of clothes you
wear?
MAIN: 
COMPLAINING GIRL: Huh... I didn't expect that from you.
COMPLAINING GIRL: I thought not...

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

GAMER STUDENT: All right, here we go! First: Use button 1 to go sideways!
Mmm... That's not quite far enough. Let me to a little more...
H-Huh...!? Button 1 stopped working!? You mean, if I let go of
button 1, that's all I get!? NOOOOOOO!

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

NEWSCASTER: --new auto-control system in cars is implemented... Experts
predict less skidding on rainy days.

=== CLUBS HALL ===

FEMALE STUDENT: The Culture Clubs' recruitment drive seems to have started.
There's three clubs: music, art, and photography. You can
observe any of them before joining. They've got a different
feel then the sports clubs, so think hard before joining one.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

YUKARI: Did ya hear, Main-kun? Photography Club, Art Club, and Music Club are
recruiting new members. ...I heard Fuuka is in one of them, but...
which one was it?
MALE STUDENT: You know Fuuka from the class next door? She's so cute, man.
Thank god she's back. She's like a piece of fine art. She should
always be on display, right?

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

MAN: Hey, how are things?
MAIN: 
MAN: Yeah... You've gotta be groovy to come to a place like
this, huh?
MAN: I ain't that groovy... Maybe it's because I don't usually
come here...
WOMAN: I'm a Gekkoukan student, but... Remember those rumors that were going
around the other day? I hate hearing rumors like that. How about you?
MAIN: 
WOMAN: Oh, really? I'm jealous...
WOMAN: You too? I can't stand hearing those conversations...
But when I'm here, it's all okay. I don't have to worry
about a thing.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

FUUKA: Junpei-kun said you're playing an online video game. Is that true,
Main-kun?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: Oh, so you can play with people from all over the
country, right? You can only do that with an online
game.
FUUKA: But, Junpei-kun gave it to you, right? It'll just go to
waste if you don't play it. Besides, you might have a
lot of fun.
MITSURU: Let me tell you about my Persona... It's strong against ice... but
it's weak against fire. As you know, nothing is perfect. Just keep
that in your mind.
AKIHIKO: Balance is very important in battle. You need power, stamina, skill,
speed, and luck. Of course, my Persona is developing along those
lines.
JUNPEI: Do you think The Lost will ever be cured?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Yeah, maybe if we defeat a Shadow, the spirits it ate
will return to their owners. But then again, they
might just get digested.
JUNPEI: If that's true, then... Whoa, dude... I'm starting to
freak out just thinking about it.
FEATHER HAWK: Come to Paulownia Mall to see us! We won't be there,
though.
NARRATOR: Phoenix Ranger Featherman R, every Sunday! Don't miss it!
NEWSCASTER: ...And now, the news.

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: I heard there was a baseball player who got kicked off the team
for hitting the coach. After that, I heard he hit an old man!
I'm surprised there's a guy like that at our school...
FEMALE STUDENT: He probably just has a short temper, right? Or maybe he's
stressed out, since he couldn't release it in the club.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: Fuuka seems to be doin' alright. I was worried some people might give
her a hard time, since she was out for a while. I wouldn't let them get
away with that, man.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: So, , have you been monitoring your physical condition?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Good. Your health is very important.
MITSURU: If you get sick or tired, you'll become extremely
weak in battle. You may also pass your illness on to
the other members, so... please pay closer attention
to your health.
YUKARI: I thought Mitsuru-senpai forced Fuuka into this... But, she's doing
her best. So I have to do my best too!
NEWSCASTER: --rain festivals long ago. Especially this year, when
forecasters are expecting little rain, the festival is
called for...

=== FRONT GATE ===

GIRLFRIEND: I'm waiting for my boyfriend. We're going to the accessory shop at
Paulownia Mall.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

Movie-loving Man: I'm a graduate of Gekkoukan High, and I hear there's some
ghost stories over there now. The stories have this really
original flavor to them... It's that perfect Japanese style
of horror, you know? That's what I think, anyway.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

MATURE GIRL: My teacher uses special stationary, but... It's so childish. We're
sixth-graders, and he treats us like little kids.
MAIN: 
MATURE GIRL: Oh, there's pictures of Mr. Fox and Mr. Raccoon,
and stupid jokes... He never talks, but he doodles
on this paper all day...
MATURE GIRL: Like, Mr. Bear and Mr. Frog are on it, and they're
rapping... It's weird. He's so quiet, I didn't
imagine he was thinking of that.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===


=== PAULOWNIA MALL, EVENING ===

JUNPEI: You know how I use two-handed swords, right? Someday, I'm gonna find
it... The LEGENDARY SWORD!
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: How can you deny a man's passion like that!? That's
cold, bro! C'mon, you've gotta dream big!
JUNPEI: Thanks! I'm gonna do my best.
JUNPEI: Sure thing, right? Let's hope we can find it.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Is it an individual problem, or a collective problem...? In
essance, does a group of Shadows target a single human and
ravage his mind... or do Shadows individually devour human
minds so they can survive...? This is what we must discern.
MITSURU: ...I'm thinking right now... If you're looking for someone to talk to,
you've got the wrong person...
AKIHIKO: Don't worry about Shadows getting stronger... We'll continue to
progress up Tartarus. We have to do our best... If we do, we'll win.
If we don't, we'll lose. Heh, it's as simple as that.
FUUKA: I've estimated the strength of the remaining Shadows... It'll be tough
to defeat them, but not impossible. If you train consistantly, we can
win. So, keep up the hard work.
JUNPEI: All we have to do is defeat the remaining eight, right? Then let's do
it, man!
YUKARI: Tartarus is filled with mysteries... Why did it appear...? How long has
it been there...? Do you think we'll ever know the answers?
NEWSCASTER: Our topic today is the rising divorce rate among June
brides. Lately, divorce is becomming more common, sometimes
happening immediately after the honeymoon. What causes
this? We'll report, right after these messages.

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

FUUKA: Wow, no one's here... Everyone must have left... Hm? Don't I go out?
Well, if there's a computer around, I usually stay inside. Why don't you
go ahead, Main-kun? I'll be fine by myself.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

STATION ATTENDANT: Every year during the rainy season, a lot of umbrellas are
left in the lost and found. The lost and found box is full
almost instantly, and I have to take care of it, and...
Rainy days are depressing.

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR, EVENING ===

YUKARI: Koromaru is such a loyal dog... And he's cute, too.
JUNPEI: I wish I was a dog, so I could get girls' attention...
FUUKA: Don't you think Akihiko-senpai would look good with a dog? Not
an unusual one, just an ordinary, playful dog...
YUKARI: Yeah, that's true. I could see them running on the beach
together...
FUUKA: Mitsuru-senpai and Akihiko-senpai are not here today, so we can't go to
Tartarus.
JUNPEI: Koromaru is really one of a kind, huh...
FUUKA: What kind of dog do you think would be good for Mitsuru-senpai?
YUKARI: Hmmm... I can't see her with a dog...
JUNPEI: She'd probably have a doberman. And she'd feed it filet
mignon...
FUUKA: Junpei-kun... I think you've been reading too much manga...

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

Fortune-loving Girl: I don't really have any friends... But I'm trying to make
some. So I asked Mama how I could meet more people. Her
answer was still pretty abstract, but at least it was an
answer! I'll try doing it next time...
Girl's Friend: Well, normally, meeting new friends is something that just
happens. In this case, I guess you might rely on fortune-
telling, but... It's not my style. I'd rather look for friends
on my own.

=== CLUBS HALL ===

Cell-phone Student: I'm thinking about downloading games to my cell, but
I don't know... They say it's cheap, but it all adds up.
Got any recommendations?
MAIN: 
Cell-phone Student: Hmm... I'll keep that in mind.
Cell-phone Student: Hmm... I'll keep that in mind.
Cell-phone Student: Hmm... I'll keep that in mind.
Cell-phone Student: Oh... Well, whatever.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: Eight left, huh? Well, you can count on me, bro! I'll defeat every one
of 'em and save the city!
YUKARI: It's still not clear to me... My head hurts from thinking about
it.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

Cat-obessed Boy: I talked to my dad about getting a cat again. I told him cats
from the animal shelter are free... But he still said no. Even
though he's okay with it, if my mom says no, he has to say no
too. So only my mom can decide... My dad sucks.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: My Persona's skills are advancing rapidly. It is also growing stronger
and faster. It is similar to Takeba's Persona, however mine is more
offensive-minded as opposed to support-oriented.
FUUKA: I found some interesting information online the other day... Apparently,
there was an unexplained explosion near our school ten years ago... At
the same time, a large number of students refused to go to school...
The news reports stated that the incidents were somehow related. Isn't
that fascinating...?
JUNPEI: Hey, when normal people Transmogrify during the Dark Hour... why do
they turn into coffins...? Are they pretending to be dead? I heard that
works if a bear is about to attack you... Actually, I just made that
up.
NEWSCASTER: --has burned down, causing the neighbor's home to burn down
as well. Police are investigating the possibility of arson.
For our next story... A dead body was found behind Port
Island Station last night. The victim seems to have been a
student at the nearby high school. The police are currently
searching for any evidence relating to the incident.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

OLD MAN: Say, what kinda dance is popular nowadays in the clubs? Reggae? That
"rap" junk? In my day, it was the tango, or the jitterbug. You danced
with your girl, not to show off. I fell in love at first sight with
my wife at one of those dance halls...

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

FORTUNE TELLER: Would you like to know your fortune?
MAIN: 
FORTUNE TELLER: Very well... Shadows within shadows... Many

Twelve shadows, feasting upon the heart of

around you... Beware... Farewell, then...
May your future be bright...
FORTUNE TELLER: Come back any time...

=== NAGANAKI SHRINE ===

SALARYMAN: My project lead is so loud and obnoxious. He gives me these crazy
lectures as fast as he can, at the top of his lungs, and they don't
make sense. He keeps spitting on my face when he does it, too...
That's why I need this time to myself.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: I wonder where Akihiko is... If he's going to be late, he should at
least have the courtesy to call me.
JUNPEI: There's a bunch of different Shadows, and they all have different
Arcana. You can tell them apart by looking at their masks.
YUKARI: Our Personas' abilities are amazing, aren't they? Secret powers that
only we have... It's too bad we can't tell anyone about them.
NEWSCASTER: A girl was found standing motionless in the middle of the
street, halting traffic for several minutes. The
expressionless girl has since been led away by police. A
number of these cases have been cropping up, causing extra
problems for the police force...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

AKIHIKO: You seem to be able to do anything... You don't really dwell on the
past, do you? I wonder how that feels...
NEWSCASTER: --tourists flocking to the aquarium to see the sea hares.
A warning for tourists, though; Be careful of the dry
weather and guard against heat stroke. Next, a report on
more people standing in the road, blocking traffic...

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: I just saw Akihiko-san... He had a weird look on his face... Maybe his

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: My Persona is resistant to ice attacks, and it also has ice skills.
With them, not only can I inflict damage upon our enemies, but I can
also freeze them. So, do not hesitate to ask me to go to Tartarus.
NARRATOR: --wedding planners working hard to bring about eternal
love... But the divorce rate is still on the rise. Studies
show that one out of every five newlyweds will divorce within
the year.
NEWSCASTER: That concludes our special report. Now, back to the news.

=== CLUBS HALL ===

FEMALE STUDENT: You know how you use rubbing alcohol for science experiments?
Well, I heard there's a teacher who drinks it, saying it's as
good as regular alcohol... But that can't be good for you! I
wouldn't try it if I were you. Believe me, it's not worth it.

=== ROOFTOP ===

STALKER GIRL: Eww! Did you see that!? That guy over there just picked his nose.
Gross...
STALKED BOY: Dude, that girl keeps following me around. She's actually pretty
cute, huh?

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

Short-haired Housewife: I get tired of coming up with new things to put into my
son's lunch. I wish his school had a Student Shop like
Gekkoukan's.
HOUSEWIFE WITH BRAIDS: I heard Gekkoukan's Student Shop offers a few
different types of bread. But I also heard
there's a limit to how much they sell. I hope
some kids don't end up going hungry...

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

LAZY STUDENT: I heard some guy made friends with the workers, but isn't that a
waste of time? I'm comfortable being the guy's customer. I don't
need to be his friend, too, you know? I mean, I'm sure there's an
upside to it, but... I'll pass anyway. Too much trouble...

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

TAXI DRIVER: I been reading that "Talking for Morons" book. I tried starting a
conversation with a fare... And he comes back with "Don't talk to
me, I'm tired." That's what I get for opening my mouth...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: The mood around here has been so serious lately, I thought I
would lighten things up. So, today I will be performing my top
ten jokes for everyone...
JUNPEI: Dude... What did he come here for...?
FUUKA: I know that Ikutsuki-san just wants to entertain us, but his jokes are
really silly. What should I do, Main-kun?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: O-Okay... Like this? "Oh, Ikutsuki-san, that's so funny!
Ahahaha... ha... ha..."
FUUKA: O-Okay... Then I'll just say, "I'm sorry, but I don't
find your jokes funny..."
FUUKA: O-Okay... I'll try that.
FUUKA: O-Okay... I'll try that.
MITSURU: That's one of the few indulgences the Chairman has. Please, just
ignore him. By the way, I've been meaning to tell you about my
Persona... It is resistant to ice attacks, and it also has ice skills.
With them, not only can I inflict damage upon our enemies, but I can
also freeze them. So, do not hesitate to ask me to go to Tartarus.
YUKARI: Well, I understand how he feels... But, it's just so lame...
NEWSCASTER: Everyone slows down as they get older, but some people are
getting fed up with it. We spoke to local youth, who have
a message for irresponsible adults.
FEMALE TEENAGER: Before you tell me to stop talking on the phone, maybe
you could stop stealing people's seats, you know? God,
you guys totally have no right to get on our case like
that.
NEWSCASTER: Next, more vacation news...

=== FRONT GATE ===

GIRLFRIEND: I'm waiting for my boyfriend... A lot of weird stuff's been
happening to people lately... But, come to think of it, it's only
been happening to couples... Hmmm... Maybe I should walk home
alone.

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: I heard some students from this school relapsed into Apathy
Syndrome. This time, it was just males and females who were
together... It's so weird. I hope we're okay.
FEMALE STUDENT: But... It's not that weird for a guy and a girl to faint
together, is it? ...Or is it? It's like... They fainted
together... Wow.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

FEMALE STUDENT: Did you hear about the two recent victims found unconscious?
I bet fewer people will be cheating on their significant others
from now on. After all, one of them was a man and the other a
woman. Those are pretty incriminating circumstances, if you
ask me.
MALE STUDENT: You hear about that couple they found together? Part of me is
glad it wasn't me... and the other part is jealous, since I've
never had a girlfriend.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

OLD MAN: That mysterious Apathy Syndrome affecting couple is on the rise... Do
you have a girlfriend? Men have to fight for their women, even if you
know you can't win. I'm proud to say I've done the same thing in my
day.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: Do you know about Shinshoudo?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: That's good. I recommend you make use of what it has
to offer.
MITSURU: Then, allow me to explain... Shinshoudo is located in
Paulownia Mall, and it will be reopening on 9th of
next month. The Chairman said you should visit it when
you have a chance.
FUUKA: I heard at school that the latest victims of the Shadows are all
couples. There must be some reason why... Maybe it's part of the
Shadows' plan. Well, whatever it is, we should be ready for anything.
AKIHIKO: Everyone at school's talking about The Lost. It seems Shadows have
started to attack again. If things keep going like this, a Shadow will
appear during the full moon... just like Ikutsuki-san said.
YUKARI: I heard that couples are becoming the victims of Shadows now. I'm not
going to say what they were doing when it happened, but... Do you think
that means the next Shadow is starting to wake up?
NEWSCASTER: --say the chances of the dam drying up are greater than
50%. If the dry weather continues this summer, it could
turn into a serious problem...

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

SNOOPY REPORTER: The victims of Apathy Syndrome can never get their normal
lives back... Is that true or not?
MAIN: 
SNOOPY REPORTER: That's what a lot of people think, but it's
not true. The symptoms of the syndrome vary
from person to person, according to my hard-
won information. Unconsciousness, loss of

some only have minor symptoms, and are back to
a normal life already.
SNOOPY REPORTER: You got it! The symptoms of the syndrome vary

FUUKA: Mitsuru-senpai and Akihiko-senpai are not here today, so we can't go to
Tartarus.
JUNPEI: Ahem. Junpei the Wise has come up with the ultimate hypothesis!
...There is no top to Tartarus!
YUKARI: Whoa, he's finally snapped... I guess his brain has reached its
expiration date.
FUUKA: Actually, that's an interesting idea... But, wouldn't that
create a big problem for us?
JUNPEI: Uh, y-yeah, I guess so... Um, maybe I was wrong.
YUKARI: I wonder what's at the top...
FUUKA: If this was an adventure novel, there'd probably be some kind of
treasure...
JUNPEI: I know! There's a giant pinata! And when you break it... candy
pours out, and a huge banner appears, saying, "Congratulations!
You've beaten Tartarus!"
YUKARI: That MUST be it, Stupei. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a
control panel we could smash and destroy the whole place?

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

I'm overthinking this...

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

Movie-loving Man: It's the time of the year for horror movies, but there's a
difference between American and Japanese films. American
horror flicks try to shock you. You jump in your seat, your
heart starts to pound, you know? Japanese horror won't make
you jump, but it'll get into your dreams at night. You'll
wake up sweating. Everyone's got their own preference,
though.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

JUNPEI: What's up with Yuka-tan? She has daggers in her eyes whenever she looks
at Mitsuru-senpai.

JUNPEI: Yeah, maybe you're right.

YUKARI: Relax, we're just chit-chatting. What's with that look...? Don't you
trust me?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: I told you. We're just talking. Ask Fuuka if you
don't believe me... It's nothing, right Fuuka?
YUKARI: You better. Like I said, we were just talking.
YUKARI: Wh-What!? It's girl talk! Sorry, no boys... Now, go

MITSURU: There will be a full moon in a week. Do you understand what that
means?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Good, then I expect you to be preprared.
MITSURU: A powerful Shadow appears on the night of a full moon.
That means you have one week to prepare.
AKIHIKO: I think Mitsuru already told you this, but there's going to be a full
moon in a week. But, don't think too much about it, or else you'll get
more nervous as the day gets closer.
YUKARI: It's easier to plan our strategy if we know what day the operaton will
be in advance. So, have you been creating a plan?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Wow, you're a great leader!
YUKARI: That's good, I guess. We need to be prepared for the
next operation.
YUKARI: Well, you better get started! We're all counting on
you.

JUNPEI: One week until the next full moon... When I was little, I used to count
the days before important events. Did you do that too?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: So, are you ready for this big event? It's not the same
as when we were kids, is it?
JUNPEI: Man, you must've been one cool kid. Come on, let's blow
off some steam.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

ANTIQUES OWNER: Bring any jewels you find to me. I will exchange them for cards
that can be used to customize your Personas. You can offset
their weak points or strengthen their strong points even more.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

LAZY STUDENT: Dude, check this out. There's lazy people all over. What's going
through their minds? Nothing, I guess... I'm so jealous, man.
I wanna be just like them. I'm already naturally lazy, so I've
got a head start on achieving total blankness of mind!

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: Before Yamagishi joined SEES, I was handling support... so I was
worried my sword skills might have deteriorated... However, I seem to
have maintained my ability level.
AKIHIKO: Don't get nervous when a Shadow attacks. Because if you do, you won't
be able to move. Try to stay relaxed at all times.
NEWSCASTER: --leaving people wondering when they'll be able to use
their umbrellas. As a result, umbrella sales have plummeted
this year. Compared to last year's rainy season, vendors
are reporting a 70% dropoff in revenue.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

FUUKA: Have you been checking your calendar, Main-kun?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: Oh, then I guess I don't have to remind you. You're very
reliable.
FUUKA: Well, you really should. Your calendar will list events
as well as when a full moon will appear.
YUKARI: Mitsuru-senpai only tells us things we absolutely need to know. I think
she should include us more.
MAIN: 
YUKARI: It's hard to know what's going on when she makes all
the decisions. And that kind of behavior can lead to
misunderstandings...
YUKARI: Well... I know it's hard to imagine Senpai confiding in
us, but... there must be something we can do.
FITNESS EXPERT: Today's Cantonese word is "Lei Ho"! Swing your arm--
"Lei!" Lift those legs--"Ho!" "Lei Ho" means, "Hello"!
That's all for this week! Back to the news!

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: I heard a rumor that there have been more cases of Apathy Syndrome
lately. What a pain in the ass.
FAT STUDENT: It must suck to be unconscious... I mean, you don't even know if
you'll wake up or not.

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

WOMAN: Huh? Are you hitting on me? I'm afraid I'll have to pass... A guy like
you must already have a girlfriend, and I'd hate to get in her way!
MAN: Dude, that rumor is just getting started! This time I hear it's about
couples! The culprit must be a single guy... He's jealous of couples,
see? But man, if I had that kind of power, I'd get myself a woman!

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

MATURE GIRL: The first term is finally over. It never felt this long when I was
in fifth grade, but this one seemed to go on forever...
MAIN: 
MATURE GIRL: Because my teacher is so boring! Everyone in my
class wishes we had a different teacher.
MATURE GIRL: It's not just me! The other kids in my class think
so too! The class next door gets to go out and
and play with their teacher, but ours just stares
out the window...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: If my hypothesis is correct, the next full moon will be...
on the 7th, during the Dark Hour, when the next Shadow will
appear. This next operation is very important to my research.
Please prepare yourself for the next full moon.
MITSURU: It appears that the number of The Lost is increasing again. However,
it seems the new cases involve couples. Perhaps the time of year
dictates which type of victim Shadows target.
JUNPEI: Hey, Main, have you heard? Shadows are attacking couples now. I bet
they're all just jealous.
NEWSCASTER: --text message that said "I'll be a little late" before
disappearing. After she didn't return home the next day,
her worried parents contacted the police. Eyewitnesses have
placed the girl with several of her friends in town around
midnight. The police investigation is still underway.

=== FRONT GATE ===

CURIOUS STUDENT: I can't stop thinking about the observatory... I mean, we have
an observatory, but we don't even have an astronomy club.
Isn't that weird?

=== CLASS 2-F ===

YUKARI: ...I thought about everything, Main-kun... and I don't think we have a
choice. We have to do this no matter what.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

AKIHIKO: There's a full moon coming up. I can't wait to see what the next
Shadow looks like.
NEWSCASTER: --didn't come home, the parents contacted the police, who
began a search for the missing girl. Witnesses spotted the
girl last night with a friend, but the other girl is
missing as well. This is the sixth such mysterious
disappearance this month. Police are still searching for
any leads in the case...

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

FUUKA: A Shadow is going to appear the day after tomorrow... I have no idea
what kind of Shadow it will be, so make sure you're ready for anything.
As the saying goes, "If you're prepared, you won't have any regrets."
MITSURU: I don't mind if you go out, but remember that we'll be facing a Shadow
soon. Take care not to get sick.

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

Fortune-loving Girl: Hey, listen to this! I did what Mama told me, and I made
a real friend! This is so great! Maybe I should have my
fortune told next time I'm in trouble...
Girl's Friend: Amazing! Her fortune came true... She seems pretty caught up
in the moment, though... Is she going to be alright?

=== NAGANAKI SHRINE ===

YUKARI: Hey, Main-kun. Are you here to see Ken-kun too?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Glad to hear it. It's good to see Ken-kun making more
friends.
YUKARI: Really...? Why? We see each other every day at the
dorm.
JUNPEI: Awww, the little guy looked sad, being here all alone. So I talked to
him... Not on purpose, I mean.
KEN: Hello.
MAIN: 
KEN: No specific reason... I can just relax when I come here.
KEN: Junpei-san came up to me first, actually. After that,
Yukari-san came, and I'd sometimes talk to her too.

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

YUKARI: I wonder what the next Shadow will look like...
NARRATOR: On the next episode of Phoenix Ranger Featherman R!
Episode 20: Married Life! The feath--
NEWSCASTER: We interrupt this broadcast for an important announcement.
The missing elementary school girl has been found.
However, his slack expression indicates that she may
have fallen victim to Apathy Syndrome.

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR, EVENING ===

JUNPEI: Even though we've been getting stronger... the Shadows have been
getting stronger too. How long can we keep this up? What happens if we
reach our limit and then totally get our asses kicked? Man, that would
suck.
AKIHIKO: Reaching your limit means you can't get any stronger... and that only
applies to someone who's a master. Most people use it as an excuse.
They say they've reached their limit, but in reality, they've just
given up. You can start by forgetting about reaching your limit.
That's the frst step to getting stronger.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: Don't you get kinda anxious before a full moon? I can't stop thinking
about it... Luckily, that makes class go by a lot faster.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

SALARYMAN: Want to know something cool? You know this place is called the
Paulownia Mall, right? Well, you know how it got that name?
MAIN: 
SALARYMAN: Wow, you're not some average student. Kids like you
give me hope for the future.
SALARYMAN: A paulownia is a type of plant. The "Kiri" in its
Japanese name is the same one as in "Kirijo." Since
this place is under the ownership of the Kirijo
Group... Get it? I may look like a slacker
salaryman, but I know some surprising things.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Tomorrow, we will test my hypothesis... A Shadow will appear
during the full moon... That is very exciting for a
researcher, such as myself.
MITSURU: If his hypothesis is correct... the next Shadow will appear tomorrow.
FUUKA: I haven't sensed any Shadows yet... so we have no choice but to wait
until tomorrow.
JUNPEI: The battle with the Shadow is tomorrow...! I'm so psyched! Duuuuude,
I'm not gonna sleep a wink tonight!
NEWSCASTER: --Tanabata, or the Star Festival tomorrow. Many of the
wishes hung up are requests that Apathy Syndrome be
finally eliminated.

=== DORM 4TH FLOOR MEETING ROOM, DARK HOUR ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Everything will be just fine. I have confidence in you all.
But, please be careful.

=== FRONT GATE ===

GIRLFRIEND: I'm waiting for my boyfriend... We're going for a walk so we can
take a break from studying.
STALKER GIRL: He's different than I imagined... And, from what I can tell, he
has no personality.
STALKED BOY: Dude, I'm so used to her stalking me now... I don't even realize
she's around anymore.

=== CLUBS HALL ===

Cell-phone Student: I was trying out that puzzle game for cell phones, but I
didn't get into it that much. I couldn't get the hang of
the combo system. Oh well... I'll try something else.
FEMALE STUDENT: When I think of artists, I think of those people who squint and
hold a pencil up to their subject. Artists who do that,
especially the guys, just want to look the part...

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: The couples-only Apathy Syndrome that's been going around...
I heard it was the work of ghosts. They say that a couple
committed double suicide a long time ago... and now they're
infecting couples with Apathy Syndrome.
FEMALE STUDENT: I don't know or care about that ghost stuff, but I wish I could
ask them why they're spreading that. I mean, they're dead! They
shouldn't bother living couples.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

FEMALE STUDENT: Finals are a lot harder than midterms, you know... But, that
doesn't mean I'll study harder. We'll see. Sometimes the extra
effort pays off.
MALE STUDENT: It's almost time for exams again. But this time, it'll be a lot
tougher. You better go to the library and study, otherwise you'll
be screwed.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

GAMER STUDENT: I didn't understand the game before, so I lost. You should
research this one bfore you start playing, or you might lose
too... It's harder than it looks.
OFFICER KUROSAWA: The cases of Apathy Syndrome that were affecting couples seem
to have stopped all of a sudden. And those who were suffering
from it have regained their senses, thanks to you and your
friends I'm sure.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

NERVOUS MAN: The conversation died again... I keep sweating... Is it because
of the heat, or is this a cold sweat...?
PATIENT WOMAN: He's sweating a lot now, but he's usually not like that. That
type of guy is pretty popular with the older ladies who work
here. Everyone remembers his face. I was surprised, to be
honest. It's amazing how many people say hello to him at
shops...
Movie-loving Man: A movie's theme song is very important. The quality of the
movie is greatly affected by whether its theme song is any
good or not. Which reminds me... Long ago, I heard there was
going to be a Gekkoukan theme song. I think it was called,
"Gekkoukan Boogie," or something like that. I heard it was
nearly done. I want to hear how it turned out, but I wouldn't
want a traditional song for a theme...
STATION ATTENDANT: This station is near the high school, so I often spot
Gekkoukan students and their friends. You seem to be alone a
lot... Do you have any friends?
MAIN: 
STATION ATTENDANT: Great! I... I wish I'd had some friends when
I was in school.
STATION ATTENDANT: I suggest you make friends now. The longer
you wait in life, the harder it'll be.
STATION ATTENDANT: Well, that's depressing. Do what you want,
I suppose...

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

FOOD GIRL: If you swirl seafood ramen around, six times clockwise and six times
the other way, without spilling... If you do that with Hagakure's
ramen, I heard you can hook up with the person you like!
Cat-obsessed Boy: My friend at school said there was a stray cat around here.
I'm waiting here until he comes out. I'm not gonna catch him
or anything, I just want to see him. I wonder what kind of
cat he is...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

JUNPEI: Do you have an order for me, Boss? Tch... Whatever...
AKIHIKO: Mitsuru isn't here, so we're going to Tartarus tomorrow night. Just
take it easy for now.
NEWSCASTER: And now, the news... Mysterious vandalism has occured at
the hotel Champs de Fleurs. Mirrors in the hotel rooms were
shattered. Though the hotel had many guests, none of them
saw the culprit. Some guests have also reported theft in
their rooms. Police are currently investigating the
incident.

=== DORM 4TH FLOOR MEETING ROOM ===

YUKARI: Um, I wanted to apologize for hitting you yesterday... I wanted to say
something earlier, but I didn't want everyone else to hear. So,
sorry...
FUUKA: Huh? What were we talking about? Um... Oh, I heard you did a great job
last night, Main-kun! Keep it up! ......

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: Huh? Whaddya want? Don't bug me if it's not important. I'm heading
home now.

=== ROOFTOP ===

FAT STUDENT: It's almost summer vacation... I used to love summer vacacation
when I was a kid... But, not it's like, whatever. I just don't
get excited about it anymore.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

TAXI DRIVER: I got a complaint from a fare. The guy called me "reticent,
unsociable, and moody." But when I try to talk, they tell me to
shut up! This job, I tell you...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: It's okay to relect on your victory... But, there are exams next week,
so you should focus on them.
AKIHIKO: If you choose Full Assault, we will all attack. So, we won't heal or
support... You'll have to do that, Main. Do your part.
NEWSCASTER: Next, some good news... Natto has become surprisingly
popular overseas. Called "Miracle Beans" in foreign
countries, they sell five times what they do in Japan.
A well-known natto producer said, "Good thing I kept making
it!"

=== DORM 3RD FLOOR ===

YUKARI: You know, I think Mitsuru-senpai spends too much time thinking about
all this... She would probably do just about anything to annihilate the
Shadows. But, don't you think that's a little obsessive?
FUUKA: Yeah, maybe. There are a lot of old sayings about maintaining
balance in your life... They also warn against being too
obsessive.
FUUKA: It's good to do your best all the time... But, it's not good if everyone
is out of step because they're all trying too hard...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

NEWSCASTER: Our next story concerns a very rare event... A miraculous
flower which only grows once every 100 years has bloomed.
It seems to be responding to the other strange events in
town.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

Short-haired Housewife: I get tired of coming up with new things to put into my
son's lunch. My family always complains when I give
them the same dish, so I'm always looking for something
new.
HOUSEWIFE WITH BRAIDS: My friend told me about her kid at Gekkoukan,
who ordered a Porkchop Sandwich from the
Student Shop... He complained about the porkchop
in it, of all things, so she got angry at him.
She told him, "If you don't like the meat, order
some sweet pastries or Tricolor Cakebread from
now on!"

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I am very sorry about everything. If there is anything you'd
like to know about, please ask.
MAIN: 
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Yes. Ten years ago, a substantial number of
Shadows were consolidated into a single entity.
Its power was immense, far greater than any of
the Shadows currently inside Tartarus.
Experiments were performed on it, and an
unfortunate accident took place, dividing the
entity into 12 Shadows. These Shadows only
appear during a full moon.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: In the end, over 50 people were injured in the
accident... and the media placed full blame on
the Kirijo Group for the tragedy. They singled
out one researcher in particular, declaring him
the main culprit behind it all. Whether this
was actually true or not was not the issue...
The public was looking for someone to vent
their hurt and anger on. So they chose him,
even though he was a victim himself. Their
wrath was unparalled. The darker side of
humanity was most certainly on display during
that time.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Under the pretense that she was assisting the
Group, she was subjected to the experiment for
many years. So, Mitsuru wasn't born with the
ability to summon a Persona; she was forced to
learn how.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I've known him and Mitsuru for a very long
time. In fact, Akihiko joined us when he was
only in middle school. At that time, we had a
third member as well. ...But, I digress.
JUNPEI: You seem so calm, dude. Must be because you can do anything... No
matter what happens, you can always protect yourself, right?
You're always so confident... I wish I could be like that.
FUUKA: Junpei-kun... The only thing anyone knows about Tartarus is that
it creates Shadows... Other than that, we're all in the dark...
FUUKA: I don't think I need to tell you this, but we can't go to Tartarus
today... Hm? Us? Oh, since Junpei-kun doesn't understand what's going
on, I'm going to review it with him.
JUNPEI: But, if we defeat all 12 Shadows... then I won't have any more
use for my Persona. Man, it's such an amazing power... I can't
let it go to waste...
FEMALE REPORTER: Hi, I'm Trish, with today's installment of "Who's
Who." Today's subject is a man in his 20s with a
yellow cap. He's studying arts overseas, so we were
very fortunate to run into him today! ...Next is news.
Pain, pain, go away!

=== DORM 3RD FLOOR ===

MITSURU: I've caused trouble for you... We shouldn't see each
other for some time. Perhaps you should study. I'm about to review my
notes now. Studying actually helps to take your mind off things.
YUKARI: Sorry... I just don't feel like talking to anyone right
now... Anyway... I have homework, so...

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

FORTUNE TELLER: Would you like to know your fortune?
MAIN: 
FORTUNE TELLER: Very well... Guns scattered in the billowing
Shadow... Arms reach in to grasp them... Their
muzzles pointed at different shadows; their
triggers pulled on different occasions...
Where do you point your gun? What will occur
as a result of its firing...? Can you collect
all the guns that have been scattered...?
Farewell, then... May your future be bright...
FORTUNE TELLER: Come back any time...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

FUUKA: I don't think we can go to Tartarus today... Everyone seems to be
studying... I mean, I haven't seen anyone around, so they must be
studying, right?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: Okay, good. So then, when the exams are over, everything
will go back to normal.
FUUKA: Yeah, neither am I. Maybe they're not just studying...
NARRATOR: On the next episode of Phoenix Ranger Featherman R!
Episode 21: Trash Monster On The Move! Don't litter, kids!
NEWSCASTER: ...And now, the news.

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR ===

JUNPEI: Dude, don't bother me. I'm studying here, man. I don't
get good grades as easily as you do, man. Laters.

=== DORM 3RD FLOOR ===

MITSURU: I didn't mean to hide it. I told you what you needed
to know, and omitted the unnecessary details... I should stop this...
Hiding behind this door, and claiming I'm not hiding anything...
I was. I was hiding it...
YUKARI: Can I ask you a question? Is there something you
believe in, Main-kun? Something that, even when everything is terrible,
and you've been betrayed by everyone... Is there something you can
still believe in?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: You're very strong... I wish I was like you.
YUKARI: Yeah... It's a hard thing to find.
YUKARI: Haha, sorry... There's no way you could answer a
question like that, huh?

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

MITSURU ADMIRER: I guess I couldn't get close to Mitsuru-senpai this term...
But I won't give up! This summer, I'll make a perfect plan to
bring the two of us together in 2nd term! Mitsuru-senpai!
Please wait for me!
COMPLAINING GIRL: My parents get on my nerves with all that "You better study!"
crap. I wanna go out for summer vacation, but I don't know if
they'll let me. This sucks...

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: Aw, man... How am I supposed to study for exams at a time like this...?
This sucks... There's no way I can get a good score.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

OLD MAN: Whan I was a tot running around in the river, I had this friend. He's
a florist now. He asked me the other day, "When you die, what kind of
flowers do you want on your grave?" It was nice of him. He's a
scoundrel, that one, but he's still a good friend.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

FOOD GIRL: If you drink a whole bowl of Hagakure's soup, you can see the word
"WIN" at the bottom... If you trace those letters with your
chopsticks, I hear it makes you stronger in fights!

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Well, that is all regarding Yakushima. Now, you will all need
to concentrate on your final exams...
AKIHIKO: I never thought I'd be talking with you like this. You're always
cracking jokes.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Hahaha... This is no time for humor. But, I'm happy to
see everyone has a smile on their face.
NEWSCASTER: --sign is Cancer, then your lucky color is green. For extra
luck, try wearing your shoes on the wrong feet!

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR ===

JUNPEI: I'm excited about Yakushima, but that's another story... Right now, I
have to concentrate. How do you stay so calm all the time? It seems
like all you do is wander around and talk to people.

=== DORM 3RD FLOOR ===

MITSURU: I'm sure you have a lot on your mind, but concentrate
on the exams in front of you.
YUKARI: I apologized, but... I'm not sure my point got across.
It seems like... There's this wall between us. Am I making any
sense...? Well, I'm going to go study now...

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

PHARMACY SHOPKEEPER: My pharmacy's detoxifier is famous! It sucks the poison
out of your body like a healing vacuum cleaner.
Girlfriend's pimples, wive's sharp tongues... It can cure

Gahahahah!

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

MAN: Yo, how are things?
MAIN: 
MAN: It's almost summer... I'm bummed out, cause I can't get
into the groove...
MAN: I can't seem to get into the groove. It's heinous, man.
Maybe I've got that Apathy Syndrome thing...
WOMAN: I'm a Gekkoukan student. I bet you knew already, but... What I'm trying
to say is, we're having our periodic exams, and... Well, do you wanna
dance?

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Don't worry about the tickets to Yakushima. I've taken care of
them. Although, I was a little disappointed about the price...
It turns out the fare for the ferry wasn't very fair. But, when
I told the lady selling the tickets that, she just ignored me.
I was a little hurt after that.
MITSURU: Are you prepared to go to Yakushima?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Impressive. You seems to have a lot of free time to
spare, even though you had finals. I hope you did well
on them.
MITSURU: Well, we're leaving the day after tomorrow, early in
the morning. Take tomorrow to pack your things.
FUUKA: I almost forgot that we're all going to Yakushima together... I'm
getting so excited now!
JUNPEI: We should really take this time to forget about all the bad things that
have been happening, and have some fun!
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Yeah! We're gonna have an awesome time!
JUNPEI: Tch, tch, tch... I'm very disappointed in you... Do I
have to force you to have fun?
YUKARI: Ken-kun seems very mature. I can't believe he's only in elementary
school. I wish "someone" would learn from his example. I wonder why
he's like that...
AKIHIKO: Ken's going to live here... with us.
NEWSCASTER: An emergency planning session was called today... It's
dealing with the many cases of Apathy Syndrome over the
last few months. Cultural anthropologists are investigating
the causes, and...

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

JUNPEI: I came to pick some swimwear to bring to Yakushima, but I dunno which
one to get. I asked Akihiko-san, but he doesn't give a rip about
fashion. So it's up to you, dude! Tell me what I should bring!
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: The basic style, huh? I dunno, is that the style I
should go for?
JUNPEI: That's not really my thing... I don't have the body for
it, y'know?
JUNPEI: I thought of that once. It'll get a laugh, at least!
JUNPEI: Hell yeah! This is a REAL Japanese man's swimwear!
S-So I can't wear it! Wear it yourself!
GAMER STUDENT: Hmm... I don't know why, but I can't seem to get the hang of
it... I've got the coordination down, but the crane still drops
the prize every time. I don't get it...
BE BLUE V SALESWOMAN: You've heard of the Apathy Syndrome that's going around,
right? Wear our accessories and you won't have to worry
about a thing!

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

YUKARI: I came to pick out a new bathing suit, but there's nothing that
interests me. Although, I don't think it's this shop's selection...
It could just be that I'm not up for a new swimsuit at all.
FUUKA: I came to look at bathing suits with Yukari-chan. I've never bought a
bathing suit besides the school one. But I don't think Yukari-chan is
really up for this...

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

SNOOPY REPORTER: I finally got a good, solid lead. He was one of the victims in
this mysterious incident... I thought I could ask him about
it, but I guess not. Turns out, his memory of that time is a
total blank. Back to square one...

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

NEWSCASTER: --solar eclipse on the 22nd, said to be the longest solar
eclipse in history. Viewers will only be able to see 25%
of the sun from Tokyo, and 18% from Osaka. As a result of
the eclipse, the temperature will drop slightly.

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR, EVENING ===

JUNPEI: Dude, I'm so ready for this! Look out, ladies, here I come!
FUUKA: Is that all you think about, Junpei-kun...?
YUKARI: You sure know how to leave your trouble behind... I wish I
could forget my worries as easily as you do.
FUUKA: ......
JUNPEI: You gotta get the most outta life!
YUKARI: I know you're right, but still... ......
FUUKA: Mitsuru-senpai and Akihiko-senpai are not here today, so we can't go to
Tartarus. Besides, we're leaving for Yakushima soon. That reminds me...
I wonder how Yukari-chan is doing... She didn't seem very enthusiastic
about buying a bathing suit.
YUKARI: Well, it's not that I don't like Yakushima... Usually, I love
being out in the sun and swimming in the ocean... I'm just not really
up for it this time.

=== YAKUSHIMA BEACH ===

AKIHIKO: Everyone seems to be having fun... That's a good thing, I suppose.
Our operations during the Dark Hour pu a lot of stress on us. You
should relax a little, and rest up.
MITSURU: Isn't this place nice...? I came here oftem when I was young, but I
don't remember it looking quite like this.
JUNPEI: Th-Thank you, Mitsuru-senpai! Thank you SO MUCH! I could die now with
no regrets!
FUUKA: Main-saaan! Help! Junpei-kun is--Eeeek!
JUNPEI: Heheheh! You like it? You like that, huh?
No one can resist splashing girls at the beach! Heheh, I'm
gonna splash more water on youuuu!
YUKARI: You--! H-Hey, you're gonna pay for that! Take this!
YUKARI: Argh... This is such a nice place... Why does Stupei have to be here
and spoil it all?

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Hm? Is there something you'd like to know about Aigis?
MAIN: 
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I assume you are referring to the other anti-
Shadow weapons... Well, there were many
created. You could say they were Aigis's
sisters. However, they were all destroyed ten
years ago in the incident. Aigis has been quite
lonely since then.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Personas are created for human minds. So the
plan was to place a human mind inside an
anti-Shadow weapon... The only real issue was
the form the weapon would take... If the form
of the weapon was a tank, for instance, the
weapon's mind would recognize itself as a
tank... However, a tank is not a living entity.
This is crucial, you see, because the mind of a
non-living entity will not process human
thoughts correctly... so it will not function
properly, and it will soon become corrupted.
However, a mind placed inside a form that
closely resembles a human body will recognize
itself as a human being... Thus allowing it to
easily adapt to human thoughts. Therefore,
Aigis and her sisters were built in the form of
human beings.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I do not know. Perhaps it is simply a glitch in
her human recognition programming...
Regardless, it is nothing to concern yourself
with.
AIGIS: These are your lodging quarters? Very well, I shall be by your side at
all times.
MITSURU: Hm, an anti-Shadow weapon... That will be a most welcome addition.
Most souvenirs are worthless... Snow globes, key chains, postcards...
However, this is one souvenir from Yakushima that is tres bien.
FUUKA: Everyone seems so tired... Maybe we should skip going to Tartarus
tonight and just rest.
AKIHIKO: A lot of people are joining the team now... It's so much different
than before.
YUKARI: Do you think anyone will be able to tell that she's a robot? I don't.
I mean, you'd really have to be looking for a robot to figure that out.
As long as she acts normal, no one will suspect a thing.
JUNPEI: She's cute, huh? Super cute... I don't think I've ever met a machine
that was so cute before.
NEWSCASTER: --today's exchange rate. There are now 115.12 yen to the

GIRLFRIEND: I'm waiting for my boyfriend... We're going to the flower shop near
the train station.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: Starting next week, it's summer vacation!  Too bad our exam
scores have to be posted... Man, why can't they wait until AFTER we've
enjoyed our freedom?
MALE STUDENT: Dude, I was scopin' for chicks the other day at the station, and
I couldn't find any. Is it possible that this is the only school
with hot chicks?
FEMALE STUDENT: It seems like the average score went down this time... I guess
that's not a bad thing. But, to tell you the truth, I'm a
little disappointed, since I could've scored about 20 points
higher. I'll have to study harder during vacation.
MALE STUDENT: Hmm, I guess I did okay again... But, I better do some studying
over summer vacation.
FAT STUDENT: Summer sucks, man. I sweat so much my shirt gets drenched. It's
worse for me, since I'm so fat.

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

FORTUNE TELLER: Would you like to know your fortune?
MAIN: 
FORTUNE TELLER: Very well... I see a girl... She stands between
light and dark, life and simulacrum... She
falters... As if not knowing on which side she
belongs... Hm...? She is trying to tell you
something... Can you hear her words...?
Farewell, then... May your future be bright...
FORTUNE TELLER: Come back any time...

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

STATION ATTENDANT: This couple started a fight the other day with a bouquet of
flowers... Just like in the movies, the girl was whacking
the guy over and over with the bouquet. Now I get nervous
every time I see someone buy a bouquet down there, and then
walk over here...

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

GIRL: Our teacher didn't give us any homework over the summer break. The other
classes were jealous, but... I'm gonna be in middle school starting next
year...
Cat-obsessed Boy: You know how this mall has lots of food stalls? That stray
cat gets leftovers from the owners. I asked them what time
the cat usually comes, and they told me... I'm gonna see that
cat no matter what!

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: How did you do on your finals? If you did poorly, you may have to
attend summer school...
MAIN: 
MITSURU: That's very good. Well, let's see how the others did.
MITSURU: I see... Well, let's just wait and see how the others
did.
AKIHIKO: Well, the exam scores have been posted, so now we can enjoy our summer
vacation. Just don't forget to train.
YUKARI: How did you do? Well, don't worry if your grades weren't that good.
With everything that's be going on, I'm sure you did the best you
could.
FUUKA: Mitsuru-senpai is amazing... With all that happened, she still managed
to do great on her exams. She can filter out distractions and focus on
the task at hand.  I wish I could do that.
JUNPEI: Exam scores!? Dude, I don't care about that! Defeating Shadows is more
important than getting good grades! Any time spent studying could be
used to go to Tartarus and--
MITSURU: Don't get carried away... You should still study. You can
learn from a defeat... But sometimes that is the hardest
lesson.
AIGIS: Main-san, I have a question. How would you classify the facility known
as "school"?
MAIN: 
AIGIS: Roger that. I will categorize "school" as entertaining.
AIGIS: I must disagree with that assessment. Analyzing your
facial expression, categorizing "school" as boring is
inaccurate.
AIGIS: I am sorry. It is inaccurate to categorize "school" as
nothing. Perhaps you should reevaluate your personal
classification system.
NEWSCASTER: In children's news today-- Ah, we've just received this
bulletin. More Apathy Syndrome patients have been sighted.
They seem to be relapses of the same patients from the
previous months...

=== OFFICE HALL ===

MITSURU: ... I saw your exam results... Good work. Here, this is
from the Chairman... It's a reward for effectively balancing school
and battle...

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

SALARYMAN: I was talking to someone from the Kirijo Group the other day, and we
got to talking about that girl. You know, the owner's daughter,
Mitsuru-san. I heard she goes to your school. Did you know that?
MAIN: 
SALARYMAN: I guess you guys know more than me, then.
SALARYMAN: Well, even if you did know, it's useless knowledge.
She's way above us lower classes.
SALARYMAN: What!? I've never known anyone as lucky as you, kid.
I'm so jealous... I skip work too often to meet
anyone as high-class as that.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

AIGIS: The data regarding the newest resident, Ken-A-ma-da-san, has been
recorded. I am able to communicate with him at any time. Please permit
me to do so.
MITSURU: He moved into the dorm, but he's not a member of SEES yet. Don't talk
to him about anything regarding Shadows.
AKIHIKO: It won't be that bad... Just try to get along with him, okay, Main?
FUUKA: Don't you think Ken-kun's cute?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: He reminds me of a little brother. I just want to take
care of him.
FUUKA: Oh... Well, I guess men and women have different
opinions...
FUUKA: He is, but that's what makes him cute.
KEN: Uh, Main-san... My name is Ken Amada. I'm pleased to meet you. I just
moved into the dorm. I'll be staying here for the summer.
JUNPEI: Ken, huh...? Hmm... Ken... I don't know what it is, but there's
something about him... Maybe it's that he's more mature than I am...
What do you think?
YUKARI: Hey, I hope Ken-kun won't be involved in this...
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Oh, I'm so relieved... Thank you.
YUKARI: ......
YUKARI: That's true... Ikutsuki-san did say that he has the
potential.
NEWSCASTER: Next up, news from overseas. A recent fashion show in Milan
HAD AN UNUSUAL THEM: "Life in Space." Those attending
watched supermodels wear space suits down the runway, and
ate delicious space food.

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

MITSURU: He moved into the dorm, but he's not a member of SEES yet. So be very
careful what you say around him. And don't talk with him about
anything regarding Shadows.
KEN: Everybody's so much older than me... I'm a little nervous about living
here...

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

Short-haired Housewife: Our kids are off on their summer vacation. I'm
exhausted from making their meals every day.
HOUSEWIFE WITH BRAIDS: One of the women in my neighborhood says she
precooks massive amounts of udon. Then she
rotates between sesame dressing, ponzu, and
shredded daikon so it always tastes differently.
I figure we housewives need summer vacation,
too, so I decided to copy her method.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

JUNPEI: Ken, huh? Hmm... I dunno what it is about that guy, but my "Junpei-
sense" is going crazy around him. Either he's a little punk, or he's
WAY more mature than I am... I dunno, man is it just me?

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

NARRATOR: On the next episode of Phoenix Ranger Featherman R!
Episode 23: Here Comes A New Challenger! Ninja Locust

FEATHER CONDOR: Hey, guys! There are some grim-looking folks out there,
but you viewers are okay, right? After all, you've got
me looking out for you! So don't worry! We'll meet
again next week!
NEWSCASTER: ...And now, the news.

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR, EVENING ===

YUKARI: I've been thinking... If the number of The Lost keeps growing, then
won't the country eventually collapse? There's so much riding on our
shoulders.
JUNPEI: Damn, I never thought of that! If that happens, how will I shop at the
convenience store?
YUKARI: I guess the concept is too big for your brain to
comprehend. You're an idiot, ya know that?
FUUKA: If this country falls apart, what will happen then...? Will Japan be
taken over by another nation, or... No, I shouldn't think like that...
We have to stay positive, right?
AIGIS: I have conducted a simulation to predict the outcome. First of all, The
Lost are a strain on society, since they drain resources but are unable
to contribute anything. But, that is only the beginning. These
individuals also require care, which means many people will quit their
jobs in order to attend to them. Fewer and fewer people will be
working, so society's productivity will plummet. Eventually, this
country will no longer be able to sustain itself, and chaos will result.

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

Fortune-loving Girl: I lost a ring in my room, and the other fortune-teller
couldn't find it. But when I asked Mama, she told me where
it was on the first try! It's like a dream...
Girl's Friend: Amazing... I've got a few things I'd like to find, too. Maybe
I should ask her...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

JUNPEI: Ken respects Akihiko-san so much. But, I can totally understand how he
feels. I mean, Akihiko-san's won his last 16 boxing matches. Every
little kid should look up to him. He's like a hero, don'tcha think?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: I wish I was a hero.
JUNPEI: Tch, you just don't get it, man.
KEN: Sanada-senpai, you always wear those gloves when you fight, right? I heard
you're undefeated with them on.
AKIHIKO: Yeah... It's no big deal, really...
AKIHIKO: I'm used to girls staring at me... But it's kind of weird when a
little kid is doing it...
AIGIS: I will use a gun during battle. I am not heavily equipped, and my damage
output and accuracy rating are both average. Because a gun is a long-
range weapon, I will not fall during an attack. A gun is best suited to
those who require stability in their weapon.
FEMALE REPORTER: Hi, I'm Trish, with today's installment of "Who's
Who." Today's subject is Trish's type of guy! He's
smoking hot, and still in his 20s! It seems he wants
to be a policeman, just like his brother. ...Next is
news. Pain, pain, go away!

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

FUUKA: If the incident occured because the Kirijo Group was perforiming
experiments on Shadows... Then that means... Shadows existed before
Tartarus and the Dark Hour ever appeared. So then, how long have Shadows
been around...?
MITSURU: We've been very busy this month... And we haven't been to Tartarus
very often. So please prepare yourself for the next full moon.
YUKARI: Akihiko-senpai acts differently when Ken-kun's around. Have you
noticed?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: I wonder why... Maybe he just doesn't get along with
kids. I mean, Senpai IS kinda awkward in social
situations.
YUKARI: You're kinda slow, huh? Maybe you should pay better
attention to social interactions.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

AIGIS: I want you to know my strengths and weaknesses. I am weak against
electricity, but incredibly strong against piercing attacks. Yukari-san
is also weak against electricity. We have many similarities.
FUUKA: As I said earlier, we shouldn't go to Tartarus today. I know you want to
go because there's going to be a full moon soon, but... please forgive
me.
NEWSCASTER: There's been a slight change of plans: today, we'll tell
you about the Apathy Syndrome cases. It's a very mysterious
illness that affects those with unstable minds or
psychological problems. Its victims can only graon, and
they don't eat or talk normally. Researchers still don't
know what causes it, but we do know that people can recover
from it...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: The veterinarian told me that Koromaru is in stable condition. The
wound was severe, but fortunately there wasn't any damage to his
internal organs.
AIGIS: I do not understand the canine language, but I have scanned the image he
was sending. I am able to receive similar images from all living things.
They are weaker versions of the voice communication human beings use.
FUUKA: I heard Koro-chan is fine now... Do you think the priest who passed away
saved him?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: The bond between a human and a pet is so beautiful.
FUUKA: No, it definately was.
YUKARI: Koromaru is an alpha dog. He must be a pure breed.
JUNPEI: Dude, everything's so messed up. First, a robot can use a Persona, and
now a dog can? What's next, a monkey?
AKIHIKO: Koromaru did great. He protected what he was supposed to protect. He's
a good dog...

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR ===


=== DORM LOUNGE ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I heard that there is a dog that can use a Persona. I've been
researching the possibility for a long time, but I never
thought it was true. I mean, can you imagine? A dog using a
Persona! A dog! I'm...
MAIN: 
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Oh! You read my mind! Hmm, I didn't know you
were so funny.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Well, it's nothing to be concerned about...
Worrying at such a young age will only lead to
a loss of hair follicles...
KEN: You all stay up so late. I try to stay up as late as you guys, but I'm
always the first one to fall asleep. What do you guys do when you're up so
late?
MAIN: 
KEN: Wow... High school must be really hard.
KEN: Are you sure you should be doing that? If you stay up late
goofing off, you're going to fall asleep during class.
KEN: So, what are you saying, that I'm just a kid? Well, you're
not that much older than me, you know.
NEWSCASTER: --the heat, the number of heatstroke incidents is on the
rise. The problem particularly affects Apathy Syndrome
victims, since they are unable to move...

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

ANTIQUES OWNER: Personas are interesting, aren't they? Summoning them must be
quite easy for you and your friends... Unfortunately, no matter
how hard I try, I can't summon them. Which is a shame because
it would've made my research so much easier... Although, I
understand that being able to summon a Persona has its own set
of difficulties. ...Well, good luck.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: Hm? Are you worried about how Koromaru is doing?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: I understand how you feel, but Koromaru has a
professional veterinarian tending to him, so he'll be
fine. You should be focusing your attention on the
full moon that is coming up.
MITSURU: Oh. Well, I just wanted you to know that he's doing
fine at the moment.
AIGIS: My Persona can be likened to a shield and a halberd... It will learn
both support skills and physical abilities. I will be a valuable ally on
the front line in battle.
YUKARI: Do you remember that Shadow from the other day? You know, the one
Koro-chan defeated? Well, for some reason it reminded me of something
Mitsuru-senpai was talking about. Normal Shadows don't appear outside
Tartarus... But, there are irregular ones that do. Only our senpai have
seen them.
KEN: Huh? Oh, I'm drinking coffee. How do you drink your coffee, Main-san?
MAIN: 
KEN: I thought you would. Putting milk and sugar in your coffee
is childish. See? I drink my coffee black, just like you.
KEN: Hm, that's not bad either, but I prefer mine black.
KEN: Huh? H-Hot sauce? You mean, like hot sauce used to make
your food spicy? You're just kidding, right? I mean, no
one would put hot sauce in their coffee... would they?
WEATHER MAN: It's blazing hot today! It's been over 86 degrees out for
days! Make sure you have enough water, and keep your
energy up! Now let's join our regular reporters back in

If they hadn't been found in time, they could have died, so
be careful out there...

the operation didn't go as I expected. So, to avoid any similar mistakes
in the future... I'm going to do visualization training so I can react
to any situation. I will do my best to support you all.
JUNPEI: C'mon, we can't let Koromaru beat us! Let's go to Tartarus, man!
AKIHIKO: Junpei's afraid of Koromaru making him look bad. Well, he does have a
point there. I don't know how comfortable I am with a dog getting all
the credit, either. Alright, make sure you get me when you go to
Tartarus.
NARRATOR: On the next episode of Phoenix Ranger Featherman R!

Tartarus and level up, man!
Long-haired Housewife: Don't those kids look strange? That one near the

slack, and unmoving... Is he being lazy since it's
summer vacation?
Short-haired Housewife: One of the women in my neighborhood has a kid
who goes to Gekkoukan... But she's energetic
and sweet, very different from those kids.
STALKER GIRL: Did you just see that!? Look at that guy by the fountain! I was
wondering what he'd do with his gum once he's done... And he spat
it into the fountain! So disgusting... What is he thinking!?
STALKED BOY: Sometimes, that girl over there who's stalking me loses my trail.
Then what...? I don't know why, but I get anxious when that
happens. Wait a sec... Am I obsessed with her, too...?

midnight. I've got a daughter who's about that age... I wonder how
she's doing...
SALARYMAN: Everyone thinks those ghost stories and Apathy Syndrome is so bad,
but... Personally, they make me jealous. In today's society, the
weak just get fired, and then they die from hunger. It's much easier
to give up like them, and die slowly while doing nothing. Heh,
someday you'll have jobs like mine and reach the same conclusion.

=== NAGANAKI SHRINE ===

SNOOPY REPORTER: I've got a scoop! These incidents all started with that god in

Understanding those is thekey to doing it right. It seems like
it has more depth than I thought...

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

NERVOUS MAN: The beach... She's asking me to go to the beach...? How did this
happen? Am I really allowed to go...?
PATIENT WOMAN: He's a sweet guy, but he seems to be holding back. It's like he
won't allow himself to enjoy life. Even after his friend and I
offered to take him to the beach. He just keeps turning us down,
over and over... He'll never have fun that way. But I won't
leave him. Don't get me wrong.
LAZY STUDENT: You sure see a lot of couples during summer vacation, huh? Maybe
I should get a girlfriend... It's a lot of trouble, though. Women
are such a pain. They're all touchy-feely, you know? I don't have
a problem with them, really, but I'm too lazy...
Movie-loving Man: When you hear locust sound effects on a show or a movie,
doesn't it remind you of summer? Did you know they usually
cut the locust sounds out when exporting movies or TV to
other countries? In places with no locusts, when they hear
that sound, they think it's just static or white noise.
STATION ATTENDANT: During summer vacation, this place is so quiet, since there
aren't any students rushing onto the train. I like the

MAIN: 
Cat-obsessed Boy: Okay! Then I'll tell you! It's a stray cat!
But he's my friend. The first time I met him,
he didn't even run away. He came up to my

But he's my friend. The first time I met him,

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

FUUKA: Everyone seems thoroughly exhausted... Since Mitsuru-senpai and
Akihiko-senpai are not here, let's not go to Tartarus today.
YUKARI: Let me get this straight... If the Dark Hour disappears, then our
Personas will disappear too? That's basically what those Strega people
were saying, right...?
JUNPEI: Dude, our missions are always so tiring. But, last night was even
worse, since we ran into those Strega guys. Man, they really piss me

However, the members of Strega also appear to be our enemies. So, please
be careful.

MITSURU: I never thought there would be Persona-users other than us. We don't

enemies. And they're filled with malice and hostility.
FUUKA: Lucia wasn't able to detect those people who call themselves Strega...
They must be very powerful to be able to slip through her "net." Who are
they...?
AKIHIKO: Those guys are up to something... I'm just not sure what. It seems
that their goal and our goal have intersected. But, next time they get
in our way, I'm going to beat them down. That's all there is to it.
AIGIS: There are four Shadows left to fight. But, we should not forget about
the danger Strega poses to us, either. We must remain on guard at all
times.
YUKARI: Summer school, huh...? Well, it's not that I don't like to study...

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Dogs can be very reliable, you know. Why, there are rescue
dogs, seeying eye dogs, narcotic detection dogs... Let's put
our trust in Koromaru.
MITSURU: Don't forget that you are a student, and students are supposed to
study. Use this time to increase your Academics.
FUUKA: By the way, how are we going to feed Koro-chan? Are we going to buy dog
food, or cook homemade meals for him?
AKIHIKO: Just like in sports... No matter how strong you are, if you don't
study your opponent, you can't win. It's the same with school... If
you don't study, you can't pass your test.
AIGIS: Koromaru-san equips a knife in his mouth and performs an acrobatic move
to attack. He is close to his enemy when he attacks, so he is very
accurate. On the other hand, he does not inflict a great deal of damage.
That completes the analysis of Koromaru-san's battle style.
KOROMARU: Arf!
KEN: We're going to take care of Koromaru here at the dorm... It'll be a lot of
fun having him around.
JUNPEI: Dude, this sucks. Summer school is so lame. Don't you agree?

JUNPEI: I feel like I'm gonna become one of The Lost...
JUNPEI: Acting nonchalant as usual, huh? Man, I wish I could be
that way.

YUKARI: Summer school, huh... What a pain.
JUNPEI: Damn right... I'm jealous of Koromaru, since he doesn't have to
do any studying.www
FUUKA: Everyone hates summer school, but I think it's necessary. After we
defeat the rest of the Shadows, we'll become ordinary high school
students again... And if we fall behind in our studies, we'll be in big
trouble later.
JUNPEI: That's it! Junpei the Wise has another brilliant idea! All I have to do
is become a dog! Then, I won't have to go to summer school either!
KOROMARU: Woof! woof!
FUUKA: Koro-chan is trying to say something...
JUNPEI: I bet he's complimenting me for being so smart.
YUKARI: I bet he's laughing at you, saying how stupid you are...
Stupei!
KOROMARU: Woof!

JUNPEI: There's gonna be a Summer Festival at the shrine tomorrow. You goin'?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Really? Well, I probably won't go. I'm in a bit of a
financial crisis. Plus, I don't have anyone to go with.
JUNPEI: You should go. It's gonna be fun.
JUNPEI: Yeah, I probably won't go either.
AIGIS: I have learned the meaning of the Summer Festival. It seems like a very
interesting event. I am looking forward to wearing the special item of
clothing called a yukata. This will be a new experience for me.
YUKARI: Huh? Our senpai went out again? Where do they get the energy? I'm so
tired... I think I'm going to go to bed early tonight...
FUUKA: Our senpai aren't here, so we can't go to Tartarus. But, don't worry.
We'll be able to go soon.
NEWSCASTER: --up, a report on the Festival. The man riding on the
portable shrine was knocked off. He was uninjured, but
three of the shrine bearers underneath him were

consider this a special security assignment and escort Mitsuru-san
there.
MITSURU: As you can see, , no matter what I say, she
doesn't listen. Please help me out here.
AIGIS: Negative. Operation Summer Festival cannot be aborted.
MITSURU: She really wants to go... Well, I guess I've got no
choice in the matter...
MITSURU: You should attend the Summer Festival at the shrine. Hm? Me? Oh, thank
you for asking, but... I don't like crowded venues.
AIGIS: Negative. We must deploy together.
MITSURU: ......
FUUKA: The Summer Festival at the shrine? Oh, um... I already made plans...
Sorry...
KEN: I don't really like festivals. Does that make me weird?
MAIN: 
KEN: That's what everyone says. They say I should act more like

KEN: Oh... I'm a little surprised to hear that because everyone
always says I'm weird. But, you're different, Main-san...

he eats a balanced and nutritious diet.

Movie-loving Man: Here's a question for you! Why do you think I'm so reluctant
to catch movies at the theater duing the summer?
MAIN: 
Movie-loving Man: Got it in one shot! They blast the air
conditioner all day in there! I have to wear
extra layers, even in hot summers like this.
Movie-loving Man: Well, that's true sometimes, but it doesn't
really have to do with summertime.
Movie-loving Man: How would I know!? That's a terrible joke...
If this place goes out of business, I don't
have anywhere else to go!
Movie-loving Man: Who cares...? And who is this manager!? I'm

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

YUKARI: It's getting so hot outside. You could get heatstroke just sitting
outside--at night! I'd better hurry up and finish my shopping, so I can
get home.
FUUKA: It's convenient for a shopping mall to be near the dorm, isn't it? On
hot days, you don't have to spend as much time walking out in the sun.
STALKER GIRL: Is this... disillusionment? I didn't realize he was that kind of
guy. I'm gonna stop following him. This is so disappointing!
The last thing I need is another guy like him.
STALKED BOY: I don't know why, man, but I'm starting to fall for her... What
should I do? I can't just keep doing nothing! Maybe I should go
ahead and talk to her, y'know?
LAZY STUDENT: Argh... So lazy... Maybe I've got heatstroke... Nah... Who'd
believe that? I'm just real damn lazy, y'know?

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

bad...
JUNPEI: Ahahahaha! That's awesome! He wouldn't eat it! Ahahahaha! That cracks
me up!
KOROMARU: 
FUUKA: I know that Koro-chan didn't mean to hurt Yukari-chan's feelings. But...
I'm sure she's a little down...  I don't know what to do in this
kind of situation...
KEN: Mitsuru-san took Aigis-san to the Summer Festival... I didn't hear
anything on the news about it, so no one must have noticed that Aigis is a
robot. She must've been in stealth mode...

Main-kun?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: That's what I thought. Most boys tend to do their
homework all at once.
FUUKA: Good, that's the easiest way to do it. I've been doing
my homework every day, so I'm almost done with it.
AIGIS: Korormaru-san's Persona is strong against fire and darkness. However, it
is weak against light. So, please be careful of Hama skills.

a new assignment and make you stay after school. Then
you can't come to Tartarus!

about gothic lolitas and art...
KEN: This is Yukari-san's magazine. It was just lying around so I took a look
at it. Those clothes featured seem to be very expensive. You must need a
lot of money to be a female.
AIGIS: Koromaru-san's Persona's agility increases in a rapid pace. This is most
likely because Koromaru-san is fast himself. Taking him for a walk can
be quite tiring.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

STATION ATTENDANT: There's always more trouble around that spot during summer

give you more and make you stay after school to do it.
Then you won't have any time to go to Tartarus.

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

AIGIS: The number of The Lost is a good measure of the strength of a Shadow.
The more victims there are, the stronger the Shadow. Based on our data

so... But the classes are boring, so in the end,
it's not a good thing.

our Persona abilities would disappear without a trace.
So, we'll probably just go back to being ordinary high

YUKARI: So, you only think about the battles we still have to
fight, huh? You're really focused.
FUUKA: A lot of people have been writing about The Lost in their blogs lately.
There are only four Shadows left... We have to defeat them and stop the
damage they're causing to society.

JUNPEI: ...Hmph.
FUUKA: It's important to focus on exploring Tartarus and defeating Shadows...
but doing our summer vacation homework is just as important. In fact, it
may be more of a priority because of the time constraint...

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I am very impressed with Ken. He is quite brave for his age.
When I was in elementary school, I was a real scaredy cat. I
used to cry and run away when a bee would come near me.
MITSURU: He is very decisive... I believe he would be a great addition to SEES.
His age worries me, though... We will need to keep a close eye on him.
AKIHIKO: Ken's a pretty amazing kid... Even Ikutsuki-san thinks so. He's young,
but he thinks like an adult. ......

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR, EVENING ===

AIGIS: The spear is Amada-san's weapon of choice.
YUKARI: Really...? That's unusual...
JUNPEI: Yeah, it's not as easy to handle as a sword... I wonder why he
chose that.
AIGIS: Most likely because of his size. A spear evens out the
disadvantage he might have against a taller enemy.
FUUKA: That makes sense. I'm not surprised Ken-kun thought of that.
JUNPEI: Going into battle at his age... Ken's da MAN! If he sticks with me,
I'll show him how it's done! He can call me Junpei-senpai.
YUKARI: Stop acting like a little kid... Ken-kun's more mature than you
are.
FUUKA: Junpei-kun and Ken-kun look like brothers. They make quite a pair.
Junpei-kun is the silly older brother, and Ken-kun is the reliable
younger brother.
JUNPEI: Yeah, Ken couldn't ask for a cooler older bro then me!
YUKARI: Why is Junpei acting like that? Oh, right... Since he's not in any

MAIN: 
AKIHIKO: Good. I'm counting on you.
AKIHIKO: I'm asking you, please. I'm not very good at that kind
of thing.
KEN: My weapon of choice is the spear. Its hit rate is high, but the amount of
damage it does is minimal. I have to attack enemies little by little...
So, please don't get mad if it takes me a long time to defeat them.
FUUKA: Akihiko-senpai has been acting strange lately. He must be having a hard
time with Ken-kun fighting in the battles... Akihiko-senpai is very
kind, which is difficult to tell from his appearance.
MITSURU: Summer vacation will end soon. Have you finished all of your homework?
There's going to be a full moon soon. I hope you are prepared to be
busy again.
AIGIS: Amada-san is small, so he uses a spear with a long reach. This enables
him to compensate for his small stature and fight bigger enemies.
Indeed, a spear is the perfect weapon for Amada-san.
YUKARI: I should do my homework... I still have a little left. But, I don't
think Junpei's done any of his. He better not ask to copy mine, or I'll
smack him!

"Uhhh," but they don't do anything. I think it'd be cool if
they started attacking us, like one of those horror movies.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

SNOOPY REPORTER: The number of victims of those mysterious incidents is
increasing. Have you noticed the pattern to the victims so
far? Based on what's happened so far, they increase one week
before every full moon... And once the full moon is over, they
all disappear. That's all we know so far. This mystery... It's
related to the full moon, I know it...

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

JUNPEI: Hey, is there anything I can get involved in?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: That's true... Why am I asking you...?
JUNPEI: Yeah, you're right... I have to discover it on my
own...
JUNPEI: Hey, you didn't even think about it. ...But still,
you're probably right.
NEWSCASTER: A popular band sold every seat in the house for their
latest concert... But on the day of the show, the audience
was completely empty. It seems most of the ticket-holders
had contracted Apathy Syndrome...

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

FORTUNE TELLER: Would you like to know your fortune?
MAIN: 
FORTUNE TELLER: Very well... A dark past, sinking into the deep
shadow... It enfolds the people who are
involved, and captures them... Who are the ones
that are trapped...? Hard though I try to see
them, my vision blurs, and everything becomes
obscure... Can you see...? Farewell, then...
May your future be bright...
FORTUNE TELLER: Come back any time...

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

YUKARI: Junpei's acting weird again... I don't know what's gotten into him,
but... he should really be concentrating on his homework.
NARRATOR: On the next episode of Phoenix Ranger Featherman R!
Episode 28: Dimensional Beast! The enemy is--cute!?
NEWSCASTER: ...And now, the news. The Apathy Syndrome that's becoming
more widespread...

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

KEN: Oh, that's right. I haven't told you about my Persona yet, have I? Well,
it has powerful light abilities. Which means it is weak against darkness
skills, like Mudo.

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

YUKARI: Junpei seems depressed... He probably gave up on finishing his
homework...
JUNPEI: Chidori, huh... She's definitely a weirdo...
NEWSCASTER: --finally August 31st. Children will return to school
tomorrow for a new term. To get rid of those sad faces, we
suggest...

=== FRONT GATE ===

GIRLFRIEND: I'm waiting for my boyfriend... We're going to the coffee shop near
the train station.

=== SCHOOL LOBBY ===

VENDOR: I see that Apathy Syndrome stuff on the news a lot these days. It seems
like there's more of them. I'm scared... You guys should watch out,
too. If it spreads too wide and the school shuts down, I'd have to look
for another job...

=== CLUBS HALL ===

Cell-phone Student: Whaddya want? I'm playing a card game on my cell, so buzz
off.

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

MITSURU ADMIRER: You saw Mitsuru-senpai in a bathing suit at Yakushima!?
Did you get any pictures!?
MAIN: 
MITSURU ADMIRER: Well, where are they, then!? Don't joke
about something like this! I'll beat you
bloody!
MITSURU ADMIRER: Oh... Some help you are.
COMPLAINING GIRL: I totally knew it! My parents were so annoying, saying, "Go
study! Go study!" I wasn't able to wear my great new clothes
during summer break! The sky was blue... The sae was blue...
Why did my heart have to be blue, too!?

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

ANTIQUES OWNER: I wonder what the essence of a Persona truly is... I was never
able to learn that during my time as a researcher... I hope I
won't be searching for that answer the rest of my life...
Sorry, I don't mean to complain to you.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

LAZY STUDENT: I'm feeling incredibly lazy... Guess why...
MAIN: 
LAZY STUDENT: Yep. You know me, man.
LAZY STUDENT: Well, that too. But it's mainly cause I'm still
stuck in summer vacation mode...
LAZY STUDENT: Aww, c'mon. I'm not that bad.
LAZY STUDENT: Sheesh, way to kill the mood. Now I feel even
lazier...

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

MATURE GIRL: The second term has started... I have that boring teacher again. I
don't mind studying, but I can't stand the way he teaches...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: I told the Chairman that Aigis should come to the school with us. I
really couldn't think of any reason why she shouldn't... and the
Chairman agreed.
AIGIS: I have a question, Main-san. Why can't Koromaru-san attend school? I do
not understand why I am permitted to go to school while Koromaru-san is
not.
MAIN: 
AIGIS: Nowhere in the school regulations does it state that
canines are prohibited from attending school. My
question remains unanswered.
AIGIS: A tacit understanding that is not listed in the school
regulations... My question has been answered. Thank you
very much.
AIGIS: Is it so difficult of a question that no answer can be
given?
KEN: When Aigis-san dresses like that, she looks like an older sister.
YUKARI: If she wears summer wear, everyone will be able to see her mechanical
arms, so... we decided she should wear winter wear. I don't think
anyone will find that suspicious...
JUNPEI: Dude, I think she's really cute... I bet there will be a ton of guys
who's gonna get a crush on her. The way she walks... The way she
talks...
FUUKA: I gave Aigis some winter clothes to wear so she's covered up. I hope she
won't be too hot in them.
AKIHIKO: I had nothing to do with this, alright? It was all Mitsuru. I don't
know anything about what happens at school. If anything happens at
school, I'm not gonna be held responsible for it.  What is
Ikutsuki-san thinking...?
NEWSCASTER: Our topic today is the ethical problem of freedom of
expression... A leading paper printed an Apathy Syndrome
victim's picture without masking his identity, and...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

FUUKA: Shinjiro-senpai seems scary, but I think he's just misunderstood... I
don't think he's a bad guy. I mean, he's good friends with Akihiko-
senpai.
JUNPEI: Shinjiro-san kicks ass, man! With him back on the team, no one can beat
us!
YUKARI: That's the guy who helped us out at that place, right? So, he used to
be a member of SEES, huh... He seems okay, doesn't he?
AIGIS: Koromaru-san told me something interesting... He said Shinjiro-san has
been feeding him from time to time.
KEN: Shinjiro-senpai seems very strong. But, is he dependable? I mean, he was
at that place, and... I guess I'm just not very trusting.
NEWSCASTER: --food channel will be introducing you to another popular
food. Last year, the meal was Consomme Soup... What will it
be this year? Coming up after these messages, today's
special report will be on Apathy Syndrome victims...

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR ===

MITSURU: I truly am glad to have you back, Shinjiro. But, I can't help
wondering what motivated you to pick up your Evoker once again...
Something must have affected you profoundly. I won't ask you now,
though.
SHINJIRO: I appreciate that. Maybe someday I'll be in the mood to tell
you...
MITSURU: ......
AKIHIKO: I've been waiting for this day, Shinji... I'm ready for battle right
now, in fact.
SHINJIRO: Tch. You're as hot-headed as always.
SHINJIRO: Well, you better not fall behind. I'm gonna take it easy for today,
but starting tomorrow, call me whenever.

=== CLUBS HALL ===

FEMALE STUDENT: Male students never seem to be able to do much in home
economics. They're going to have trouble if they ever decide to
live on their own, though. As for me, if my button fell off or
something, I'd be able to sew it back together in a second!

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: I heard from my friend that there are going to be cafes and
stuff at the Culture Festival. My club doesn't do that kinda
stuff... It looks fun, though.
FEMALE STUDENT: But aren't those cafes going to be the ordinary, boring kind?
That's so dull... They need to have some kind of twist to them.
I hope someone comes up with a crazy idea...

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: I have inspected the entire school, but I did not locate anyone
suffering from Apathy Syndrome. Should I conclude that they are absent?
JUNPEI: Were you listening when she was talkin' about the Culture Festival?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Dude, a cafe is soooo lame. Why don't we do something
fun? Like a heavy metal cafe!
JUNPEI: We're running a cafe. A CAFE, for heaven's sake! It's
so typical. Why don't we do something fun? Like a heavy
metal cafe!
MALE STUDENT: What the heck? It's pretty rare for a hottie like that to
transfer in at this time of year.
MAIN: 
MALE STUDENT: Dude, get a clue! I'm talkin' about Aigis! A
mysterious babe like that... I want to know
everything about her, starting with her
measurements!
MALE STUDENT: Dude, get a clue! I'm talkin' about Aigis! A
mysterious babe like that... I want to know
everything about her, starting with her
measurements!
FAT STUDENT: It must suck to be the "new girl." All the guys hit on you and
pressure you right away. But, Aigis-san seems fine...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: Shinjiro, Akihiko, and I were all in SEES when we were in middle
school. A lot of things have happened since then, but... there's no
need to doubt Shinjiro. I assure you that he's reliable.
AKIHIKO: There's going to be a full moon soon. You should probably get the team
ready to go. If you're looking for a change, you should add Shinji to
the lineup. You'll be surprised by his strength.
SHINJIRO: Tch, it's no big deal.
SHINJIRO: I'll join you guys. I used to be a member of SEES, and I'm your
senpai... so you can count on me.
KEN: My Persona is good with light skills. Hama can take down any opponent in a
second! W-Well... maybe not ANY opponent, but... Oh, and it's also pretty
good with electricity skills... but not as good as Sanada-senpai's
Persona.
FITNESS EXPERT: Today's Cantonese word is "Houshonah"! Streeetch and
say, "Houshonah!" "Houshonah" means "tough"! It's tough
when someone you like tells you "Houshonah!" That's all
for this week! Back to the news! Don't let Apathy
Syndrome or the hot weather get you down! See you next
time!

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

SALARYMAN: I guess I've been laid off... Or maybe they're just acting like I
was laid off. Laid off is just a euphemism, for when you want to
fire someone who's working his ass off. I think I did my best at
that company... My mind is so blank now, it's hard to think...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I am very confident about tomorrow's operation... What, with
Shinjiro-kun rejoining us... I have no doubt we will be
victorious.
MITSURU: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, but such confidence can only lead to
certain failure. While it's true that Shinjiro is quite
powerful, he hasn't fought in a very long time. We must all
concentrate on the task at hand and perform with flawless
execution to win.
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Must you always be such a killjoy?
MITSURU: Why is Iori so excited about tomorrow? There's going to be a full moon
tomorrow... I don't think that's anything to look forward to.
SHINJIRO: Give me space when I'm fighting. My aim's not that great, but if I
hit an enemy, it's history. I don't play around... I destroy
whatever's in my way. I'm here if you need me.
JUNPEI: What's up, Main? Being a hero's so cool! I can't wait until tomorrow,
dude!
YUKARI: I didn't think he could get any dumber, but... Hey, do you think
we could replace him...? I mean, Shinjiro-senpai just joined us, so...
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Uh... I was just kidding. I don't really want to
replace him. I just wish he wasn't so annoying.
YUKARI: Of course. I don't really want to replace him. I just
wish he wasn't so annoying.
AIGIS: Junpei-san's current status is extreme happiness. I have learned how
people describe that state in modern language... "He has gone to La La
Land."
KEN: My Persona's skills and agility progress fast. Which is good... because
that covers for my lack of power.
NEWSCASTER: --international convention, introduced new technology
called NewClear. The process is so amazing that people have
started to call it, "NewClear" In today's special report,
we'll investigate, what is this "NewClear"?

=== DORM LOBBY, DAYTIME ===

SHINJIRO: Can't believe he's into a girl now... He's getting soft, huh?
MAIN: 
SHINJIRO: He should be focusing on what's important.
SHINJIRO: Alright, if you say so.
SHINJIRO: Trust me, girls complicate life.
AIGIS: Strega member Chidori has been sent to a Kirijo-run hospital...
Mitsuru-san and Akihiko-san are currently on their way there to
investigate her. When neither senpai is present, we are not permitted
to go to Tartarus.
FUUKA: Strega slipped through Lucia's "net" when we encountered them last time
too. Most likely it was due to Medea's ability to distract... We only
saw two of them, but the girl must have been somewhere close.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

Short-haired Housewife: I think the hot summer sun got to me... See? My arms
are tanned, and my skin is all rough.
HOUSEWIFE WITH BRAIDS: Do you know the ramen restaurant Hagakure at
the Iwatodai strip mall? The ramen they sell
there has plenty of collagen to boost your
beauty! That's what I heard, anyway. If you
make your skin more youthful, I bet your mind
will follow, and your husband will love you
more!
GAMER STUDENT: Whew... That was close. I never miss now, but somehow, I still
can't get it. The claw grabs the prize, but it'll fall before
it reaches the hole, or the prize is just totally stuck.
OFFICER KUROSAWA: You know your friend, the one with the hat...? Well, he
didn't look like himself... He seemed really down. But,
there was nothing I could say to cheer him up. ...Sorry.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

STALKER GIRL: Hmm... It feels like someone's watching me... Is it just me...?
STALKED BOY: Dude, what's going on? That girl who's been following me all this
time... I was gonna talk to her, but she stopped following me.
I've been watching her to try to figure out what's going on, but
this seems kind of weird...
STATION ATTENDANT: School started again... The students have been fun to watch
this term. All those people trying to look good after
vacation, who can't pull it off... Inside, I just smile at
them and laugh.
SNOOPY REPORTER: I've got a very interesting story, from a friend of one of
the victims. Let's call them Friend A, and Victim B. They
were playing at A's house during the incident. B left A's
house at 11:50 P.M., and A noticed B forgot something, so A
called B. But the call didn't go through, so A chased after
B. The time was 10 minutes past midnight when A discovered B
lying on the sidewalk. Know what that means?
MAIN: 
SNOOPY REPORTER: You're a clever kid. The incident occured
within 20 minutes of midnight... I calculated
the time it'd take to reach that point, and
it would have been around midnight. Midnight
seems to be crucial to the mystery...
SNOOPY REPORTER: I'll tell you what it means. The incident
occured within 20 minutes of midnight... I
calculated the time it'd take to reach that
point, and it would have been around midnight.
Midnight seems to be crucial to the mystery...
SNOOPY REPORTER: Impressive! If only all kids were as bright
as you. But that aside... The incident occured
within 20 minutes of midnight... I calculated
the time it'd take to reach that point, and
it would have been around midnight. Midnight
seems to be crucial to the mystery...
Movie-loving Man: It's September, and it's time for a new term. Did you get
any transfer students?
MAIN: 
Movie-loving Man: I'm jealous... Your school life is just like
a teen movie. You're a lucky kid. Go enjoy
school while you can.
Movie-loving Man: I thought not. Transfer students are usually
pretty rare.
MAN: There's a mahjong club at the gang spot, and one of the guys there is a
mahjong demon. He said, "Let me test my luck," and challenged me to a
mahjong duel. I came pretty close, man... If I'd gotten the "Peacock," I
could've beat the guy...

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

FOOD GIRL: When you order a medium beef bowl, order a raw egg with it and drop
it onto the beef bowl. If you can get the egg in the middle of the
bowl, I heard you'll become more popular in school.
Cat-obsessed Boy: I asked my friends about what to feed cats, and I read about
it too. I found out there's a lot of things that cats
shouldn't eat. Like that milk I tried to give him last time,
that's one of them. I was surprised, but I learned
something.

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: I was not surprised to learn that she is Strega's support
member. Capturing her shall provide us with quite an
advantage... We are moving ever closer to completing our
mission.
YUKARI: Junpei seems to really like that girl. What should we do?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Cheer him on, huh? But, what should I say...?
YUKARI: Hmm... Ignoring him is a bit drastic... Maybe we just
shouldn't encourage him.
NARRATOR: On the next episode of Phoenix Ranger Featherman R!
Episode 29: Final Battle! Did a random brawl put Hawk out of
commission!?
NEWSCASTER: ...And now, the news. The latest victim is the 5th case of
Apathy Syndrome this month...

JUNPEI: ...... Sorry man, I wanna be alone right now.

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

WOMAN: Hmm? I see... I always thought the men in this club weren't that good-
looking, but... Oh... Um, never mind...
MAN: Did you know the wiring here is in bad shape? We just barely squeaked by
during big events. The weird thing is, it's fixed now, but no one ever
called maintenance...

=== FRONT GATE ===

CURIOUS STUDENT: Hey, listen to this... No one's ever seen anybody using the
observatory... I mean, why have it if no one's going to use
it? That's just a waste of money.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: Yeah, what's up? I'm going to the hospital to see Chidori... No one
better try and stop me... If they do, I'll be pissed!

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

TAXI DRIVER: My daughter's a high school student, but she fell in with a bad
crowd. I see her midnights on the job. My wife yells at me to
tell her to cut that out, but kids her age... They'll never
listen.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

KEN: Mitsuru-senpai and Sanada-senpai are both still at the hospital? Their
questioning of Chidori must not be going well...
SHINJIRO: My Persona doesn't have any weaknesses. For your Persona to have a
weakness, the Persona-user has to have a weakness. ...And I don't.
But, my Persona also doesn't have any resistances, so I guess that
makes it even.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: Junpei-san has left school. He went to the hospital. Lately, he seems to
be emotionally unstable.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

NERVOUS MAN: Why am I like this...? How many months has it been with her?
PATIENT WOMAN: It's that time of the year, huh? Do you have a girlfriend? I bet
you could get one if you tried. You can do it! Just find someone
you're interested in, and talk to her. Even he managed to do it,
so you should have no problem.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

FUUKA: There are so many things we don't understand about Chidori... Lucia is
unable to sense her... Her state of mind is very unstable... And she
hurts herself...
SHINJIRO: He's going to see her, huh? Tch, what an idiot...
NEWSCASTER: --planning to take the Matsutake mushroom hunting tour.
Tourist reservations are skyrocketing, and...

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

OLD MAN: It's almost time for the Culture Festival for you kids, right? Good
luck getting ready. It's an important opportunity for you to get to
know your classmates.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

YUKARI: Ken-kun uses a spear, so he has a lot of reach when he attacks. Next to
a bow, a spear is probably the best long-range weapon. But with a
spear, you can only cover a small area in front of you. And if you miss
with a spear, you'll probably get counter-attacked.
SHINJIRO: No one's attack is more powerful than mine. Healing and support...
Tch... I don't do that crap... so don't look at me if you need help.

=== CLUBS ESCAPADE ===

Fortune-loving Girl: Whoa, Mama's fortune-telling is great! I did just what
Mama told me to, I found out something new about my
friend... And now, we're closer than ever! Incredible...
I really look up to that woman.
Girl's Friend: Something new about her friend, huh...? Aren't you supposed to
find stuff like that out on your own? I have a really bad
feeling about this.

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

COMPLAINING GIRL: I've been thinking... Don't you think Aigis seems different
somehow? Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying she's a weirdo.
She seems like... a doll. When I see her, I'm reminded of a
clothing store mannequin.
MAIN: 
COMPLAINING GIRL: Haha, I thought as much.
COMPLAINING GIRL: Haha... You don't have to agree with me. It's
probably my imagination, after all.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: Junpei-san went to the hospital. He seemed eager to get there. Has the
questioning been going smoothly?
MAIN: 
AIGIS: I'm hoping for useful information.
AIGIS: That's unfortunate, but not unexpected.
AIGIS: Do I detect an underlying meaning? Is there something
between her and Junpei-san that I am not aware of? I am
confused.

=== ROOFTOP ===

FAT STUDENT: Culture Fest, dude, Culture Fest... Everyone just loooves Culture
Fest! But, not me, dude. I think it's a waste of time. In fact,
I'm hoping there's a typhoon so they'll have to cancel it... Maybe
that's a bit much, huh?

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

MATURE GIRL: I thought my teacher might be better this term, but I guess not.
He mumbles a lot, and doesn't have any energy, so class is really
boring.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

KEN: Why isn't anyone going to the hospital today? Is the investigation over?
MITSURU: Shinjiro's supressant... Akihiko's expression... ......
AIGIS: Koromaru-san wants to communicate something to you. He is tired of
eating the same food day after day. I recommend you changed Koromaru-
san's menu.
MAIN: 
AIGIS: Koromaru-san seems happy to hear that. Thank you.
KOROMARU: Arf! Arf!
AIGIS: That is very disappointing. Koromaru-san seems
depressed.
KOROMARU: 
AKIHIKO: We probably won't be going to the hospital again... Chidori hates
us... Well, I guess she doesn't hate ALL of us.
SHINJIRO: You don't say much, do you? Heh, I can respect that. I don't like
people bothering me either.
NEWSCASTER: --lucky color for our Virgos in the audience is yellow.
For extra luck, try punching three times in front of a
mirror!

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR ===

JUNPEI: Let's say... someone tells me they want to die. So I tell this person I
don't want her to die. How does that sound? Is it awkward?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Oh, that's good to hear.
JUNPEI: You're right... I always feel weird when I tell her
that.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: I wonder what Chidori's doing right now...  I wish I could see
her more often...
MALE STUDENT: I heard a rumor that you went to Mitsuru-san's vacation home. Not
only that, but Yukari, Fuuka, and Aigis were there, too... And
the best part of this rumor is, supposedly they were all wearing
bathing suits...!? Is that true!?
MAIN: 
MALE STUDENT: No way! Are you serious!? ...Wait, don't say
anymore. I can't take it! Why!? Why are you so
damn lucky!?
MALE STUDENT: I thought so. That's way too good to be true.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: If you use Attack Fallen... we will attack any enemies that have been
knocked down. If no enemies have been knocked down, then we will do
our best to knock them down. During that time, however, we will be
unable to heal and support, so be careful.
FUUKA: Shinjiro-senpai's weapon has a very wide range of attack. Its attack
speed is slow, but its range more than makes up for it. It is a useful
weapon when you want to surprise the enemy.
SHINJIRO: My Persona's strength and endurance both increase fast. Its skills
and agility aren't bad, either. Castor doesn't have any weaknesses...
Well, I guess its luck isn't that great, but that doesn't matter in
battle. If you gotta depend on luck... then you're as good as dead.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

GAMER STUDENT: Hey, guess what! I finally got the prize!
MAIN: 
GAMER STUDENT: I basically just lucked into it, but I'm still
psyched. I'll keep training until I can get the
prize even without luck!
GAMER STUDENT: Dude... That was uncalled for! If you keep
acting like that, you'll end up with no friends.
Mark my words, man.

=== NAGANAKI SHRINE ===

STALKER GIRL: Huh... I still get the sense that someone's following me...
There's someone over there... Hey, that guy looks familiar.
STALKED BOY: Damn! I missed my chance to talk to her. All I seem to do these
days is follow her around... What should I do?

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

YUKARI: Whenevery I'm around Junpei... I sense a feeling of... happiness. I
wonder what happened to him...
AIGIS: Shinjiro-san used his own money to purchase expensive dog food.
Koromaru-san seems to really like it.
KOROMARU: Arf! Arf!
JUNPEI: Have you ever thought of what you're living for?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Wow, I never knew you were so deep.
JUNPEI: I didn't before either. But, I've been thinking about
it a lot lately... escpecially when I look at her. She
makes me think about what I'm living for.
SHINJIRO: Whether or not I fit into your battle plan is up to you. If I do,
great. If I don't, whatever. I'm not going to change my style for you
or anyone else...
NEWSCASTER: --today's exchange rate. They yen is now 115.23 to the

FORTUNE TELLER: Would you like to know your fortune?
MAIN: 
FORTUNE TELLER: Very well... The golden sky spreads outside the

her slender arms... A boy struggles, searching
to find meaning in himself and the girl... But
the conclusion has not yet been written... It

You must stand firmly, and watch things
unfold... Farewell, then... May your future be
bright...

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

KEN: Koromaru always seems so happy. I'm a little jealous of him. He can be
satisfied just eating a meal.  I wish my life was that simple.
AKIHIKO: I heard Shinji's a really good cook. I can't say from experience,
though. I've never had anything he's made.
FUUKA: I'm glad Junpei-kun is back to normal. But, do you think his
relationship with Chidori-san will work out? She's a member of Strega,
and they're our enemies.
MAIN: 
FUUKA: I really hope so.
FUUKA: It's such an ironic twist of fate.
MITSURU: How are you getting along with Shinjiro? He's a little rough around
the edges... But, deep down, he's a really nice guy. Just give him a
chance.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

Cat-obsessed Boy: I asked my dad if I can take this cat home. He said he

YUKARI: Shinjiro-senpai is pretty dependable, don't ya think? He's physically
strong, but he also knows how to keep his cool.
FUUKA: Yeah. He looks scary, but in reality, he's more like a big
brother.
JUNPEI: With Shinjiro-san here, the atmosphere is so much more serious...
AIGIS: With Junpei-san here, the atmosphere is so much childish...
JUNPEI: Ouch! That hurt, Ai-chan. I have no comeback for that.
FUUKA: I'm really happy Shinjiro-senpai joined us... But, I need to be careful.
If I rely too much on his skill, I'll never realize my full potential.
JUNPEI: Wow, you're amazing...
YUKARI: Instead of being amazed, maybe you should try to be more like
her.
AIGIS: With Shinjiro-san as our ally, we are a more formidable force. This is
the ideal time for us to ascend Tartarus.
YUKARI: Yep. The best defense is a good offense. That's how you win...

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: Everyone seems excited about the upcoming festival. I have not
experienced such an event before.
JUNPEI: Hey, the festival is this week, isn't it? Man, I've been so busy
thinkin' about Chidori that I completely forgot. Well, screw that. I've
got enough to worry about, so I'm gonna slack off.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

Movie-loving Man: Popcorn is great while watching a movie, but I don't really
eat the stuff. After all, if you're eating, you can't be
totally focused on the movie you're watching. Huh...? You
can't concentrate if you're hungry? Ah, but that's when you
need the moviegoing spirit! My passion for movies can
overcome any hunger! Seriously!

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: We've defeated nine Shadows... which means only three remain.
That's fantastic! We are so close to the end. Please keep up
the good work.
JUNPEI: Yo, I heard there's a typhoon headed this way, dude. I hope it doesn't
just pass by... Because if it did, we wouldn't get a day off, so we'd
have to walk to school in the rain. And that would totally suck!
SHINJIRO: So, a big-ass Shadow appears during the full moon... And you've
already beat nine of 'em, huh? Not bad...
FEMALE REPORTER: --gratulatiooooons! We're in the locker room to
interview the winners! You guys did great out there!
Yeeek! Th-The beer's... so cold...!

=== CLASS 2-F ===

FAT STUDENT: The Cultural Festival kinda sucks, don't you think? I mean,
there's always that one person who's so gung ho, and makes
everyone else get involved. By the way, that person is NOT me.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

SALARYMAN: I'm keeping up the pretense of going to work. I-I can't let my wife
and little girl know that I've been laid off...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: The typhoon thrateds to cancel the festival... which is a shame. As
Student Council President, I have invested a lot of time organizing
it. So, I hope we can still have the festival, but... I guess all we
can do is trust in Providence...
FUUKA: Junpei-kun cares so much about Chidori-san. I used to think he was a bit
of a womanizer... but now he seems like such a gentleman.
AIGIS: Shinjiro-san used to frequent the outskirts of Port Island Station...
The only reason he is still alive is because he has knowledge in self-
preservation. That quality makes him quite valuable in battle.
JUNPEI: Yeah, Chidori's gonna need some time to cool down. So, I'm gonna give
her some space. It's gonna be hard. But, what can I do...?

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: I heard there's a typhoon coming. It's a big, slow one... That
means there's going to be a lot of damage, huh? This is going
to suck...
FEMALE STUDENT: Aw, man, that's the worst kind of typhoon. If it comes, you
think we'll get the day off from school? Hey, now I can't wait
for it to get here!
MITSURU ADMIRER: I don't care about the Culture Festival if I can't see
Mitsuru-senpai there. I was hoping she'd dress as a man, and
then dance with me... But I guess not. For me, the Culture
Festival is over before it began.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: I have heard that Yukari-san is going to be working at a maid cafe
during the festival. I do not understand why... but the male students
seem excited to see her wear her new outfit.
JUNPEI: Hey, I heard the Archery Club will be running a maid cafe at the
festival. I wonder if Yuka-tan will be in costume... Hmm, I doubt she'd
agree to that...

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

STATION ATTENDANT: There's a giant typhoon approaching, it seems. If the rain
gets too strong, the railways will be shut down, so please
keep that in mind. Though I don't think anyone would go out
in that kind of weather... I know I don't want to come to
work, on days like that.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

YUKARI: Guess what! I have to wear a maid outfit! Why me!? It's just not right!
MAIN: 
YUKARI: I'm so embarrassed! I feel like running away!
YUKARI: But, I DO care! I'm so embarrassed!
YUKARI: Really...? You like that kind of stuff? ...I didn't
think you were like that.
AKIHIKO: There's a typhoon headed our way... I'm not sure if it's going to hit
us or not, though...
KEN: The Culture Festival is next weekend. But, there's a typhoon coming... so
it might get cancelled. I probably wouldn't have gone to it anyway. I
really don't like being around a lot of people right now.
SHINJIRO: Culture Fest, huh... That crap doesn't interest me.

=== CLUBS HALL ===

Cell-phone Student: I tried out that card game for cell phones, but I couldn't
get into it. It wasn't hard to understand, it was just too
simple. Oh well... I'll try something else.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

AIGIS: From my calculations, the probability of the typhoon descending upon us
is extremely high. We must secure the dormitory windows and seal any
areas that are prone to leaking.
FITNESS EXPERT: Today's Cantonese word is "Kehhei"! Flex those fingers,
and... "Kehhei!" "Kehhei" means "I'm mad now!" A full
train makes you seriously "Kehhei!" That's all for this
week! Back to the news!

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: As Student Council President, I am saddened to hear the festival has
been cancelled. I suggested that the date be rescheduled, but it seems
that won't happen. Well, there is nothing one can do to hinder Mother
Nature's will.
FUUKA: You're all wet! Are you alright? You don't look so good... I don't think
you should go to Tartarus tonight. You should just rest.
AKIHIKO: Yeah, just rest tonight. I don't think anyone wants to go to
Tartarus in all this wind and rain, anyway.
YUKARI: I hate to say this, but... I'm so happy the festival got cancelled. I
mean, come on, a maid outfit!? I'd rather stand outside in the middle
of a typhoon than have to wear a maid outfit.
AKIHIKO: This building was damaged by that Shadow back in April. I wonder if
there are any leaks in it. I hope this building didn't get damaged as
badly as my ribs...
AIGIS: Due to the cancellation of the festival, we will receive 5 days off from
school. We will have the weekend off. The 21st is Respect for the Aged
Day. The 22nd is a national holiday, and the 23rd is the Autumnal
Equinox. We should spend this time wisely.
JUNPEI: We can't see Yuka-tan in a maid outfit now because the festival was
cancelled. Bummer, huh?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: I know, right? I bet all the other guys are bummed out
too.
JUNPEI: Huh? Whaddya mean you don't care!?
SHINJIRO: Making a wish... Tch, why can't he act like a normal kid...
NEWSCASTER: --huge typhoon gets closer and closer. It's hitting the
mainland right now. Depending on weather conditions, it may
pass over Japan by tonight.

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

AKIHIKO: The physical condition of a fighter is very important. No matter how
strong you are, if you don't feel well, you won't last long in the
ring.
YUKARI: Oh, you seem to be feeling better. Why don't you go get some fresh air?
It's really nice out.
KEN: Are you feeling okay, Senpei? You should take today to rest.
JUNPEI: They say idiots never get sick. Oh wait, that means... since you got
sick, you're smart; and since I didn't, I'm an-- W-Well, what do "they"
know anyways?
FUUKA: I'm glad you're feeling better now. But don't be careless, or you might
get sick again.
MITSURU: How are you feeling?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Then, let's explore Tartarus.
MITSURU: Then, you should rest a little while longer. I had my
hands full looking after Akihiko. We don't need
another member unable to fight.
AIGIS: Good morning. I am here to monitor the condition of your health. Your
temperature, pulse, and breathing have all returned to normal.
Congratulations on surviving your illness.
SHINJIRO: Caught a little cold, huh... Glad to see you're feeling better.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

Short-haired Housewife: A woman in my neighborhood said part of her roof was
destroyed by the typhoon. No matter how much we try to
prevent disasters, there's no way we can completely
guard against them...
HOUSEWIFE WITH BRAIDS: Well, I don't know. You can't trust those
building contractors, you know. It could be that
her house was just made of cheap, non-regulation
materials.
OLD MAN: So... the Culture Festival was called off on account of the typhoon,
huh? What a waste... Well, don't be too sad, youngsters. You've got
plently of time to live, so you can wait for the next one.
PHARMACY SHOPKEEPER: Vitamen supplements have become commonplace in society. No
one thinks twice about buying bottled water instead of
drinking from the tap, either. It's an attitude that's
great for my sales, but it makes me feel kind of sad, too.
BE BLUE V SALESWOMAN: Those people who stare at nothing... Do they have the
Apathy Syndrome everyone's talking about? They seem...
abnormal. It's pretty scary.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

STATION ATTENDANT: The typhoon the other day hit us hard. All the rails were
shut down. I didn't mind, though. I got to stay home and do
nothing all day.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

Cat-obsessed Boy: What should I do? That cat went somewhere... No one know
where he went. Maybe it was cause of that typhoon? If he
could've come home with me before, this wouldn't have
happened...

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

FUUKA: I'm glad you weren't sick for very long. It's most likely because you
rested for two days straight.
YUKARI: Oh, that's right... I should've made you some chicken noodle soup for
your cold. Sorry I didn't think about it sooner. Next time you get
sick, remind me.
JUNPEI: Dude, that typhoon was crazy! Everything was flying through the air...
Well, not everything, I guess. I mean, I didn't see a ramen stand
flying through the air...  I wish I could've seen that.
AIGIS: While you were resting, a typhoon passed through town. Not much damage
was incurred. There is nothing else to report.
KEN: That was a pretty big typhoon. I bet a lot of buildings were destroyed.
Yukari-san and Fuuka-san were really scared during it... Were you scared
during it too, Main-san?
MAIN: 
KEN: ...I was a little scared too.
KEN: That's what I thought. You're never scared of anything.
KEN: Oh, that's right...
FEMALE REPORTER: Hi, I'm Trish, with today's installment of "Who's

is beautiful! ...Next is news. Pain, pain, go away!

SHINJIRO: Tartarus and the Dark Hour are still here, huh... Dammit... Why won't
they just disappear? ......

NEWSCASTER: The sky is clear and blue once again. Everyone with laundry
out on the line can rest assured that it'll be dry by
afternoon.

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR, EVENING ===

JUNPEI: I wish the Typhoon was on our side... Maybe it could blow a ramen stand
into a Shadow and kill it with one hit! Wouldn't that be awesome!?
AIGIS: ......
YUKARI: ......
FUUKA: ......
JUNPEI: ......
FUUKA: Hm? What will happen to us if the Dark Hour disappears? Well, I think
we'll lose our Persona abilities and return to our daily lives... But,
we won't be the same as we were before. Thanks to all the experiences we
gained fighting together, we'll all live richer, fuller lives.
AIGIS: We have captured Strega's support specialist, Chidori. Next mission, it
is highly probable that they will be unable to determine our location.
YUKARI: Right... Having someone like that makes a big difference. It's
hard to interfere if you don't know where to go.
FUUKA: But, be careful, just in case... The other two seem dangerous...
YUKARI: Only three Shadows left... I bet they're gonna be tough...
AIGIS: Perhaps. We should train in Tartarus as much as we can.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

SNOOPY REPORTER: The mysterious incidents happen at midnight... I'm positive of
it. I've been checking around, and it's a very suspicious
time. Healthy people get Apathy Syndrome at midnight, and the
first victim was taken at midnight... There's something very
suspicious going on around that time.

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Are you feeling any better, Main-kun? I was going to inquire
earlier, but I thought you might be "sick" of everyone asking
you if you're sick...
MAIN: 
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: That is good to hear. Please take care of
yourself. AH-CHOO!
SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Oh, I didn't expect you to be so direct...
Well, please take care of yourself. AH-CHOO!
SHINJIRO: Ikutsuki-san's here. Still cracking those lame jokes, I bet.
MAIN: 
SHINJIRO: His jokes are the worst. So lame.
SHINJIRO: You can't fool me.
NEWSCASTER: --cultural anthropologists have made an announcement
regarding Apathy Syndrome. They have calculated the timing
of when victims will recover, and when new victims will be
claimed... People are waiting to hear the exact day that
victims will begin to increase next month...

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

MAN: I couldn't think at all, for a while. I had no idea what I was doing.
Then, all of a sudden, at the beginning of the month, I was totally
healed. No idea how. But I couldn't really get into the groove here,
anyway...
WOMAN: I couldn't hook up with any boys this summer. This sucks... Did you get
a girlfriend?
MAIN: 
WOMAN: So you're going to leave me here, huh...? Oh
well, I'll wish you good luck as I dance!
WOMAN: Ooh, a pair of loners! Wanna shake your ass here with me
tonight!?
FORTUNE TELLER: Would you like to know your fortune?
MAIN: 
FORTUNE TELLER: Very well... After the storm comes not calm,
but another trial... Do not despair, however...
I sense strong forces at your side, even more
so than before... Be brave, and confront this
hardship with unshakeable resolve... Farewell,
then... May your future be bright...
FORTUNE TELLER: Come back any time...

=== SCHOOL LOBBY ===

VENDOR: I heard the Culture Festival was canceled. Too bad. My house got
soaked in that typhoon! It was a huge hassle.

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: I heard that instead of postponing the Culture Festival, they
cancelled it entirely. My class wasn't going to do anything
special, but... I really wanted to see it.
FEMALE STUDENT: No way! They cancelled the entire Culture Festival!? This is
all the typhoon's fault! Stupid typhoon! Nobody wanted you to
come here!
COMPLAINING GIRL: It sucks that they cancelled the Culture Festival. I was
looking forward to seeing the out-there fashions, like the
maid costumes and stuff.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: That was a large typhoon. I expected the school to have sustained some
damage. However, I was mistaken. It must have been built with quite
durable materials.
JUNPEI: Hey, how ya feelin'? I hope your cold hasn't come back.
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: That's more like it. You can't be sick, cuz we'll have
a hard time without you.
JUNPEI: STILL? Come on, man, take better care of your health.

MAIN: 
FAT STUDENT: Huh? So you're not here about... that? Phew...
Don't scare me that way.
FAT STUDENT: Yeah, that's right. No one has to know.
FAT STUDENT: Y-Yeah... I wished for the typhoon to hit here! I
even hung voodoo dools upside down, with lots of
needles stuck in their heads! But I didn't think
the typhoon would really come! It was an accident!
It's not my fault!
MALE STUDENT: I wish Culture Fest hadn't been cancelled... It would've been a
great chance for me to meet some girls from a different school...
I don't even feel like living anymore.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: The news has been reporting that the number of The Lost is
increasing... I wish we could receive some good news for once.
FUUKA: Shinjiro-senpai is by himself a lot. Does he like to be alone...? Or is
he just shy...? To be honest, I'm a little worried about him... He must
be so sad being alone all the time...
YUKARI: Akihiko-senpai said that Shinjiro-senpai is a good cook. Cool, huh? I
never would've guessed. There's more to him than meets the eye.
JUNPEI: What's up, Main? How you doin'?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: C'mon, man! Liven up! You're young! You should have
some fun!
JUNPEI: That's not good... You gotta liven up! You're young!
Have some fun, man!
AIGIS: It is difficult to determine a Shadow's strength. Particularly these
last three. Please be prepared for the worst.
SHINJIRO: I'm on my own, huh... Well, I don't care what you guys think about
me. I'm doing things my way... and there's nothing you guys can do
about it.
AKIHIKO: Mitsuru can complain all she wants, but we only have three Shadows
left. Once we defeat them, there won't be any more news about The
Lost. We're so close.
KEN: Hm? Why am I always in my room? No reason, really... ......
NEWSCASTER: --dead man had ties to local loan sharking operations.
Police say that the lack of a struggle most likely means
his assailant was familiar with him... The victim had
likely contracted Apathy Syndrome, preventing him from

are other people who want to have their fortunes told. I
can't hog her all to myself. I guess for now, I'll stick
with the fortunes you get from TV and magazines... Those
never come true, though.
Girl's Friend: She's a little too into this fortune-telling stuff... I don't
think it's good for her.
MAIN: 
Girl's Friend: Yeah... I should confront her, huh?
Girl's Friend: Hmm... No... I should talk to her.
Girl's Friend: I can't do that.. Yeah... I should talk to her.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

SHINJIRO: You should eat healthy and get ready for winter. Shadows aren't our
only enemies; don't forget about Strega. You're gonna need to build

time. Medical workers are shocked by the number of new
victims being admitted to the hospitals...

However, the decision is final. We will not be having

has just begun... But they seem too relaxed to

OFFICER KUROSAWA: Reports about Apathy Syndrome are all over TV and the
Internet... An increase in the number of Apathy Syndrome
cases is scary... But what's even scarier are the rumors that
are spreading about the disorder... If people start to
believe that it's contagious... we're going to be in trouble.

it over with.
YUKARI: Uh... You think you can beat 'em if you fight 'em all at once?
JUNPEI: Uhh... That would be impossible!
FUUKA: ......
FUUKA: Ken-kun seems so depressed lately... I wonder what's wrong...
YUKARI: It's hard to tell. He seems like someone who always tries to
figure things out on his own. But, I'd be more than willing to
help him is there's something wrong...
JUNPEI: You know what they say about cornered animals, right? They can be
pretty scary... Well, do you think the same is true for a Shadow?
AIGIS: Is its strength amplified? I cannot say for sure, but we should
be prepared for that possibility. No matter how strong we are,
we should continue training.

there. Dude, she's soooo annoying! She's always asking
me these embarrassing questions! And when she's not
doing that, she's telling me I have to leave cuz it's
past visiting hours! She totally ruined all my precious
time with Chidori! Man, I wish she would just leave me
alone!
JUNPEI: Aw, c'mon, man! Just let me tell you! Pleeeeeease!
FUUKA: I'm amazed by our senpai... Even though our battles with Shadows are
coming to an end, they don't seem to be nervous at all. But then again,
they were the first members of SEES, so they have a lot of experience.
YUKARI: Our next operation is coming up soon... I get more and more nervous as
the day gets closer...
AIGIS: The operation will be on October 4th. We must be prepared for it.
SHINJIRO: Me? Nervous? Heh, never... All you can do is fight with all you've
got.

SHINJIRO: Ikutsuki-san is so chill. He's just kicking back right now. I told
him not to overestimate my ability.
NEWSCASTER: More data has been collected by the cultural

it takes around two weeks for victims to recover. If this
is true, then the current victims will start to recover

keep falling asleep in class.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

ANTIQUES OWNER: How is Kirijo-san? ...That's okay. You don't have to say
anything. I was just wondering... Kirijo-san has gone through
so much in his life... Difficulties when he was younger... and
the incident... You know, it's been ten years since it
happened... This city has changed so much since then... I don't
know your situation, but you're always welcome here.

AIGIS: To be victorious, you must offset your weaknesses. This may be difficult
for every team member to do, however. So, please be aware of everyone's
weaknesses.
JUNPEI: How do you think Strega will come at us this time? Since Chidori's on
my side now, they don't have anyone to provide support! They're like a
jock strap without a protective cup!
YUKARI: We have midterms this month... I wonder if we could get them to
make a rule that exams can't be scheduled right after an operation...
FUUKA: I think it's amazing that Shinjiro-senpai can cook. He's also kind and
reliable. He reminds me of an older brother. But, it's strange... Why
did he quit SEES and spend all his time at that place?
AKIHIKO: I wonder how many Shadows there'll be this time. At most, I think
there'll be two... But, if it's two powerful ones, it's going to be a
tough fight... so make sure you're ready for the next battle.
KEN: How are your battle preperations going?

SHINJIRO: Tch... You're one lucky bastard.
SHINJIRO: Well, suck it up. You'll be outta here soon.
SHINJIRO: Take it or leave it, huh? Heh, that's cool, man.
FITNESS EXPERT: Today's Cantonese word is "Toche"! Bend over, and say
"Toche"! "Toche" means "Thank you." I hope this word
catches on someday! That's all for this week! Back to
the news!
NEWSCASTER: ...And now for news. Our topic today is Apathy Syndrome...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: This next battle is going to be difficult. If you are not prepared,
defeat is probable. Have all your items and equipment ready for the
battle.
FEMALE REPORTER: Hi, I'm Trish, with today's installment of "Who's
Who." Today's subject is a 20-year-old man who's proud
of his amazing intelligence. You can recognize him by
the "#1" design, which is on all of his clothing.
...Next is news. Apathy Syndrome, go away!

=== FRONT GATE ===

GIRLFRIEND: I'm waiting for my boyfriend... We're going to
study in the library together. Wait, then why am I
waiting for him outside...? Hey, I think I made
this same mistake before...

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

SALARYMAN: I wonder how long my money will last... I'll eventually have to get
another job, for my wife and daughter, huh? But I can't seem to make
the effort... I'm so burned out after what happened...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

SHINJIRO: Tomorrow's the day. You better be ready... Let's go in there and kick
some ass.
NEWSCASTER: In today's economic news... The rising number of Apathy
Syndrome victims has led to a declining Japanese economy,
and...

=== SCHOOL LOBBY ===

VENDOR: It's sad when any student dies, no matter what they were like. I feel
like I lost one of my own children.

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: I heard about that Shinjiro guy who died the other day. You
know that area, right? Where all the thugs hang out? I heard
they were all scared of Shinjiro. I-I wonder how bad he was...
FEMALE STUDENT: Shinjiro would always hang out there, right? Too bad for him...
But I'm sure he was up to no good, too.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: It is unfortunate, but not many students are saddened by Shinjiro-san's
death. Apparently, human relationships are quickly forgotten, except in
our case.
JUNPEI: Man, I don't wanna go back to the dorm today...
FAT STUDENT: It sucks when a student passes away... No matter what really
happened, there's always rumors.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

Short-haired Housewife: I was thinking of having my older son take the
Gekkoukan entrance exam, but... I don't want him to go
to a dangerous school. Maybe I should reconsider...
HOUSEWIFE WITH BRAIDS: You mean the Gekkoukan student who was in that
fighting incident? He died, right!? I feel sorry
for him... He was too young to die. How could
that have happened?
GAMER STUDENT: Hmm... I can grab it, but I can't win... This can't be a
coincidence.
OFFICER KUROSAWA: So... he was your friend, eh? Well, you guys are risking your
lives... So I'll do whatever I can to help you out.

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

MAN: I heard a Gekkoukan student died in a fight at that spot. I could have
told anyone that place was trouble! I swear, man! I knew something bad had
to happen there one of these days!

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

LAZY STUDENT: That Shinjiro guy died at the gang spot, right? Sometimes I'll
aimlessly wander around there, but... I should quit doing that.
Movie-loving Man: Man, wasn't that typhoon nuts? If it was just a movie
typhoon, I'd be all cheering for the special effects and
stuff... In real life, it wasn't very awesome. I give it one
star.
STATION ATTENDANT: A Gekkoukan student was killed, huh...? So those gangs at
the spot are capable of murder...  It's dangerous,
being a station attendant...

=== NAGANAKI SHRINE ===

SNOOPY REPORTER: A Gekkoukan student was killed... Hmmm. This is the kind of
incident that makes the headlines. The higher-ups told me to
gather information, so here I am... But these cases aren't my
thing.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: Ken must decide what is best for him. It is a difficult decision for
such a young person to make, but I'm not worried. Ken has a strong
will... I am confident he will make the right choice.
AIGIS: I am unable to assist you in this matter. I will stand by until further
notice.
JUNPEI: Shinjiro-san was so cool... He said, "This is how it should be." Those
were his dying words... Would you be able to say that?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Wow... I could never say that.
JUNPEI: Same here... I could never say that.
JUNPEI: Ha! No way, dude! I could never say that.
YUKARI: So, Ken-kun doesn't have a place to stay, huh...? We should've been
more understanding... I wonder what he's doing now...
NEWSCASTER: --student fatality at Port Island Station. Though he rarely
attended school, he was often spotted at the crime scene.
Police believe that it must have arisen from a dispute, and
are questioning local youth.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

FEMALE STUDENT: The first semester is just a warm up. The game starts for real
during the second semester. You better use the library or study
wisely at home.
MALE STUDENT: Second semester is gonna be rough. I'm nervous already...

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

FORTUNE TELLER: Would you like to know your fortune?
MAIN: [Yes, please.]
FORTUNE TELLER: Very well... A light has disappeared... The
shadow grows darker... But the lost light's
will lives on in a strong, new light... You
have reached a turning point... The light has
begun to challenge the shadow... Your time is
coming... soon... Farewell, then... May your
future be bright...
[No thanks.]
FORTUNE TELLER: Come back any time...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: At the risk of sounding conceited, I was right. He has the soul of a
warrior. I admire his fortitude.
AIGIS: I have confirmed the metamorphosis of two Personas, most likely the
result of Shinjiro-san's death. There may be more metamorphoses to come,
so I will remain in observation mode.
JUNPEI: He's so much stronger than I am, dude... I'd be so depressed...
Probably for like three days... or maybe even a week... But just one
day? Geez, he's nuts!
NEWSCASTER: All eyes are now on the cultural anthropologists who
predicted the recovery of Apathy Syndrome victims. So far,
all of their hypotheses have been correct... Many are happy
to finally have some concrete information about the
Syndrome. One of the anthropologists is now trying to pin
down a clear date for the next victims to appear.

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR ===

KEN: I'm really sorry about what happened... You could've said no, but you let
me come back... I'll make it up to you guys... Shinjiro-san too...

=== DORM 3RD FLOOR ===

YUKARI: I'm glad Ken-kun came back... To be honest, I was really worried... I
mean, what if something terrible had happened to him...?
FUUKA: Yeah... It's so sad... all that he's been through. He's just a
little kid.
FUUKA: Let's not go to Tartarus today. We can go tomorrow, and invite Ken-kun
too.

=== CLUBS HALL ===

FEMALE STUDENT: Sorry, to ask this so suddenly, but do you like chemistry?
MAIN: 
FEMALE STUDENT: Chemistry is such a fun subject. I look forward
to every experiment.
FEMALE STUDENT: I see...
FEMALE STUDENT: I see...

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

NERVOUS MAN: "What's more important to you, soccer or me?" A-A question like
that...! She must be unhappy with me... But why...? Is she
really...?
PATIENT WOMAN: That guy is just the type to take a question like that
seriously. I was just testing him, though... But I think you'd
do fine in a situation like that. It's a trick we use to get the
guy closer to us.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Ken's parents didn't Transmogrify... so there is a slight
possibility that the irregular Shadow came from his mother.
Ken did not Transmogrify either, so he was in the Dark Hour as
well. And, well... You know the rest. I could never have
imagined things would turn out so unfortunately... I will pray
for Shinjiro's happiness in the next world.
MITSURU: He gave his life to save a life... How heroic... I'd like to think
that I would do the same if I had to... What about you?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: I'm surprised you said that. You're an interesting
guy.
MITSURU: That is understandable... It would be a very difficult
thing to do.
FUUKA: Yesterday he was here... and now he's gone... But, I guess tragedies can
happen in battle... I'm sorry. I'm still a little shaken up. I can't
think straight.
YUKARI: There's no way I can study right now... Not when a close friend just
died... I can't just forget about it and move on... I'm not that
strong...
JUNPEI: I know, I know. I should be studying. But, I just can't concentrate.
We lost so much, man... Why did he have to die...?
AKIHIKO: What's with all the long faces? Shinji died satisfied. He got out
while he was ahead. Let him rest in peace. We should be focusing on
what we need to do now... There's less than a week until the midterms.
AIGIS: Koromaru-san is in good spirits. He seems to respect Shinjiro-san for
the way he died.
KEN: I said my prayers, so I'm okay now. Grieving over a death and just feeling
down are two completely different emotions... So, yeah... I'm okay...

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: No one is talking about Shinjiro-senpai anymore, now that we have
exams. I guess people just worry about their own problems, huh? It's
kinda sad, don't ya think?

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

SNOOPY REPORTER: I'm getting shut out on this case of the Gekkoukan student...
There weren't any eyewitnesses. No one heard so much as a
scream. It's like nothing ever happened... Or at least, no one
will admit to knowing anything. They say "kids will be
kids"... But I think this goes deeper.

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

Fortune-loving Girl: She worries too much... I'm just interested in fortune-
telling, that's all. Why does she have to act like that?
I'm just trying to get as many fortunes as possible...
It's just sound daily planning, you know?
Girl's Friend: I told her she's getting obsessed with fortune-telling, but she
doesn't seem to listen to me. I won't give up on her. I'm her
friend... She needs my help, especially at times like this.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

FOOD GIRL: I heard when you buy takoyaki from Octopia and share it with your
loved one... You'll break up. So, how's you relationship going?

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

NEWSCASTER: --today's exchange rate. The current rate is 114.30 yen to
the dollar. The yen has gone down by 0.22 since last time.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: It is rational for students to concentrate on their exams rather than
Shinjiro-san's death. However, for some unknown reason... I question the
value of thinking this way.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

OLD MAN: There's this friend I've had since we were in short pants. He's a
great singer. He said, "If you die, I'll sing a song at your funeral."
It was real nice of him. Him and me, we go wayyy back.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

AIGIS: I have confirmed that everyone's spirits are low, due to Shinjiro-san's
incident. If this continues, our next mission will not be successful. We
must forge ahead.
JUNPEI: I'm going to Chidorita's tomorrow. I should really study, but.. there's
just so much going on. I usually cheer Chidori up.. But, I'm hoping she
can cheer me up this time...
AKIHIKO: So, you guys can't study because of what happened to Shinji, huh?
Well, just so you know, he's probably pissed off right now, up there
in Heaven. He probably thinks you're all acting like a bunch of little
kids. He'd want you guys to study and get on with your lives.

=== CLUBS HALL ===

Cell-phone Student: I tried out that shooter for cell phones, but I couldn't
get into it. It was so tough to dodge the bullets on that
tiny screen. Oh well... I'll try something else.

=== NAGANAKI SHRINE ===

STALKER GIRL: You see that guy over there, right? I don't know how to get rid
of him... So I'll just let him do whatever it is he's doing.
STALKED BOY: Isn't she awesome? M-Maybe I'll just keep checking her out a
little while longer...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: Have you been studying for the exams?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Tres bien! Keep up the good work.
MITSURU: I understand how you're feeling, but that is no excuse
for not studying for the exam. Unfortunately, the
reality of life can be quite cruel sometimes. Well,
good luck.
FUUKA: I usually don't have any trouble studying for exams... But when I think
about Shinjiro-senpai, I lose my concentration... But, I will just have
to do my best. Well, I wish you luck on the midterms.
NARRATOR: --easily broken bones and fragile intestines. The risk is
great for those who don't exercise. More and more children
today don't get the necessary exercise. This concludes our
special report, on Sports Day.
NEWSCASTER: Coming up next, the news.

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

FUUKA: Don't forget that we have a day off tomorrow because it's Health and
Sports Day. But, since it's the day before the midterms, I'll probably
just study. I hope you'll do the same, Main-kun. Let's do our best on
the exams.
KEN: Aigis will be taking exams for the first time. How do you think she'll do,
Main-san?
MAIN: 
KEN: I agree. She might use her processor to answer all the
questions correctly.
KEN: That's a possibility. People may get suspicious if she
does too well.
JUNPEI: R-Really...? Is that possible...?
AIGIS: This will be my first periodic examination. Since I have a human mind,
my memory is similar to that of a human being's. I will not be able to
insert the data of an entire book into my memory system. However, do not
worry. I will still do my very best.

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR, DAYTIME ===

JUNPEI: I tried to study, man, but I just can't do it! I can't get over what
happened to Shinjiro-san...
AKIHIKO: Every time I come out here to take a break from studying, I see you
here, Junpei. Don't tell me you've been out here the whole time... You
know, for it to be called a "break," you actually have to be doing
something to take a break from.
JUNPEI: Uh... We just happen to be taking our breaks at the same time,
Senpai.

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

KEN: To be honest, I was planning to go there today... but then I decided not
to. If I keep living in the past, I'll never be able to move forward.
NARRATOR: On the next episode of Phoenix Ranger Featherman R!
Episode 34: Hawk's Betrayal! Has Hawk really gone over to the
dark side...?
NEWSCASTER: ...And now, the news.

JUNPEI: What the hell is this problem!? We never learned this!
Wait a minute... they must have taught us this when I was asleep! What
a dirty trick!

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

NEWSCASTER: --lucky color for Sagittarius is pink. For extra luck, try
putting a flower on your door!

=== FRONT GATE ===

GIRLFRIEND: I'm waiting for my boyfriend... We're going to the
shrine. It's so peaceful there.

=== SCHOOL LOBBY ===

VENDOR: It's cooling down outside lately. There's no heater in the school, so
it gets freezing cold in the winter.

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

MITSURU ADMIRER: I've been thinking... Normally, if someone is hurt somewhere,
they'll bring in someone new, right? That means, if anyone in
Student Council is hurt, I might have a chance to get in...
H-Hey, what's with that look!? You act like I'm a criminal or
something! I'm not that bad! I-I'll get her without any
cheating!
COMPLAINING GIRL: My parents want me to go to one of those four-year colleges.
And after that, they think I should be a lawyer, or something
smart like that.  This is gonna suck...

=== CLASS 2-F ===

FEMALE STUDENT: This time, I know I did pretty well. I can't wait for the
results.
MALE STUDENT: It was easier than I expected, but I still missed some. So, I
guess I could've done better.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

PHARMACY SHOPKEEPER: Back in the good old days, every household had an aloe
plant for their health. I used to eat 'em as snacks.
Thanks to that, I've never been constipated in my life!
Gahahah!
BE BLUE V SALESWOMAN: I was talking to some boy with a hat the other day, about
the Apathy Syndrome victims. He said something strange...
He told me those people will be gone soon. Has he found a
cure?

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

TAXI DRIVER: I think I had that "Apathy Syndrome" thing... I took a few days
off from work. The night shift is getting tough, and trying to
talk to the customers wears me out. I want to quit, but I can't...
I've got a family to support...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Considering what you've all been through... You did an
excellent job on your exams. You should all go out and enjoy
the weekend.
MITSURU: I was worried about the team when we lost Shinjiro... But it seems
like everyone has recovered surprisingly well. He must be smiling down
on us from above.
FUUKA: I don't think I did well on the math exam. I had a hard time remembering
terms and equations... which are usually no problem for me. What about
you, Main-kun? How did you do?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: Then you must have gotten a good grade.
FUUKA: Well, don't worry. If you did okay on your other exams,
you'll be fine.
YUKARI: I don't feel relieved like I usually do after an exam. What about you?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: That's what I thought... Well, it's probably because
the last operation is coming up soon.
YUKARI: Really...? How could you be relieved knowing that the
last operation is coming up soon? You have a lotta
guts...
AKIHIKO: It seems like everyone is back on track. Now, we can start training
again. I need to revise my workout program... I'm not very happy with
my current condition.
KEN: We don't have exams in elementary school, but I'll have to take them in
middle school... Are they difficult?
MAIN: 
KEN: That's depressing...
KEN: Really? Wow, that's good to hear...
KEN: H-Hey...! You're scaring me! You shouldn't say something
like that in front of a little kid...
AIGIS: My favorite subjects are tactical theory, mechanical engineering, and
information analysis... Unfortunately, my examinations were not on these
subjects. Therefore, I do not think I did very well.
JUNPEI: Yee-ha...! Exams are over! I'm goin' to hang out with Chidori!
NEWSCASTER: The cultural anthropologists have calculated another
date... They say the next Apathy Syndrome victims will
begin to appear in one week.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

GAMER STUDENT: I asked my friend if there's some trick to it, but... Well, he
told me, but he could have been more polite about it. It's
probably because I've been neglecting him for this stupid game.
If you don't work at a friendship, I guess it fades away...

NEWSCASTER: ...And now, the news.

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR, EVENING ===

YUKARI: If the Dark Hour disappears... I'll probably spend more time with the
Archery Club. Because of SEES, I haven't been as involved.
AIGIS: What to do after the Dark Hour disappears... I cannot answer that
question. I was built solely to eliminate Shadows. Once that mission has
been fulfilled, there is no reason for me to remain active. What happens
next does not concern me.
JUNPEI: Aigis...
YUKARI: That was really depressing...
JUNPEI: Me, I'm just gonna SLEEP when the Dark Hour disappears. Cuz you know
how tiring it is fighting in Tartarus... I wanna be able to rest
peacefully for a change... A nice, deep sleep!
YUKARI: Sounds good. I could use some beauty sleep.
AIGIS: With a little maintenance, my body looks as good as new. It
must be difficult keeping one's skin looking healthy...
YUKARI: Thanks for reminding me.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

FEMALE STUDENT: I was happy with my grade. All that studying I did during
summer vacation paid off.
MALE STUDENT: Phew, what a relief... I didn't do too badly... But, my scores
will never go up if I don't take things more seriously... I'm
gonna study as soon as I get home.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

Movie-loving Man: I understand kids fighting, but murder is going too far. They
make socual dramas about this kind of thing, but... I never
thought it would happen around here.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

MATURE GIRL: My teacher got upset for the first time the other day, cause I
ditched Sports Day practice to study. I don't get it... I had to
study because his teaching is so bad!

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: Well, how did you do on your exams?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: C'est magnifique! Congratulations.
MITSURU: Good job. I knew you could do it.
MITSURU: Well, don't be disheartened. You were going through a
very difficult time.
FUUKA: I didn't do that bad on the exam, but I'm not really happy with my
score. I was obviously affected by what happened to Shinjiro-senpai.
I'm so ashamed. I shouldn't use that as my excuse. I just have to
study harder...
YUKARI: Well, the grades have been posted... so let's turn our focus back to
Tartarus. We are almost done.
JUNPEI: Whew... No F's... Now I don't have to go to Shinjiro-san's grave and
tell him I failed.
KEN: Aigis-san said she didn't do so well on her exams... She must save her
concentration for battle...
AIGIS: I performed satisfactorily in chemistry and mathematics, but I performed
poorly in the others. My concentration is reserved for battle.
AKIHIKO: I did okay on my exams... not that I really care. I need to work on my
strength. Time spent worrying about grades should be spent training.

=== FRONT GATE ===

CURIOUS STUDENT: Don't you think there's something strange about the
observatory? I mean, no one has ever heard about anyone
actually going inside of it. And, there's no trace of it
ever being used. Well, I guess if no one's ever been
inside, then obviously there wouldn't be a trace of it
being used...

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: I heard that Natsuki-san from classroom E is going to
transfer out... Her father's sick, right? She didn't seem
sad or anything.
FEMALE STUDENT: I didn't know Natsuki's dad was so sick that she'd have to
transfer... But it did seem like her smile was kinda fake,
even though she acted all energetic. I bet she had a lot of
problems.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: Fuuka-san said, "I get it." How about you, Main-san?
MAIN: 
AIGIS: Good for you.
AIGIS: Me neither.
JUNPEI: Hey, I just heard that Natsuki's transferring. You know, the girl
who's friends with Fuuka? But, they haven't been friends for very
long. ...Kinda sucks.
FAT STUDENT: Exams suck, man. People completely forgot about that Aragaki
guy now that they're studying. Or, maybe they never cared
about his death in the first place.
MALE STUDENT: Dude, the mall sucks. I'm gonna go back to my old place to
try and pick up chicks.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

Short-haired Housewife: You see Mandragora, the karaoke studio at the top
of those stairs? I saw someone coming out of there
by himself. Was he singing alone...?
HOUSEWIFE WITH BRAIDS: Well, it's not that weird... But I bet you'd
draw some strange looks from the staff. It
builds courage, in a way, to do whatever you
want, no matter what other people may think.

MAIN: [Yes, please.]
FORTUNE TELLER: Very well... A strong wind blows across the

have to eat her box lunch.

FUUKA: I'm sad that Natsuki-chan moved away. But, no matter how far apart
we are, we'll always be friends. So, I'll be fine.

she's so outgoing.
NEWSCASTER: Casinos are popular vacation spots nowadays, but...

MITSURU: The next full moon is approaching. Let's be prepared. I want to be
able to make a successful report to Shinjiro.
JUNPEI: Fuuka's really changed since Natsuki left school, hasn't she...? She
was always so down... Girl's friendships are so weird.
NEWSCASTER: Last night's increase in Apathy Syndome victims hit the

I guess I'll try to sleep more. I don't get much sleep on the night we
go to Tartarus.
KOROMARU: Arf!
FUUKA: You either, Koro-chan?
KEN: But, you sleep all day, Koromaru.
KEN: I don't think I'll do anything special if the Dark Hour disappears. I'll
be sure to tell my mother and Shinjiro-san about it, though. Hmm... If it
does really happen... I want to see what it's like to be an ordinary
elementary school student.

MAN: Hey, how are you?
MAIN: 
MAN: It's autumn already... I'd better get my groove on.
MAN: Winter's coming up. It's a tough season for people who

it's a bummer of a time for me...
WOMAN: Do you worry about your exam scores?
MAIN: 
WOMAN: Just dance, and you'll be fine! Like me! So what if
your scores are low? You won't die! Don't worry about
it!
WOMAN: Great! That's the way men are supposed to be!

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

STATION ATTENDANT: After that incident, a lot of customers have been going over
to that spot to take a peek. Well, I don't blame them. Who
knows? Any of us might be the next victim of gang violence.
I'm feeling worried myself...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Well, your exams are over now, so we should focus on the task
at hand. Only one Shadow remains. This will be the final
battle. The fate of this town rests in your hands. I believe
in you. Good luck.
AIGIS: When cornered, an enemy will fight at its fiercest... This is a basic
premise of warfare. Only one Shadow remains... I am sure that this will
be the toughest battle of all. Please make sure you are prepared for it.
AKIHIKO: My training is going awesome... I feel like I've awakened something
inside of me. When I train, I pretend someone's watching me. That
seems to get me motivated.
KEN: I received a compliment from Ikutsuki-san the other day. He told me I was
doing well for an elementary school student. That made me really happy.

You're supposed to pour the acid into the water, little by

it doesn't matter. Either way, I'm glad he'd okay.
Cat-obsessed Boy:  I decided I want to take that cat home with
me. I'm going to convince my mom to let me keep him as a pet.
No matter what she says, I'm not gonna back down.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

FUUKA: The Internet isn't just for information anymore; it's become an
important tool for communication. Every day, all around the world,
people are making new friends... and keeping in touch with old ones.
Please remember that next time you go online.
JUNPEI: Is it just me... or is Akihiko-san different now?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Instead of getting all depressed after Shinjiro-san
died, Akihiko-san got stronger. Shinjiro-san was
amazing... but so is Akihiko-san now! Too bad they
couldn't still fight together!
JUNPEI: No! Look closer! Now, can't you see the energy flowing
out of him?
NEWSCASTER: We'd like to apologize for the last report, saying Apathy
Syndrome victims had "overrun" the mall. In light of the
high number of viewer complaints, the reporter responsible
has been suspended.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: Was that Yuka-tan who just came out of the office? I wonder why she was
in there... Seems like she's having a bad day.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: Your face is so emotionless... I never know what you're thinking.
As you know, the next operation will be our last... Are you feeling
nervous?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: I understand... The tension grows stronger day by
day...
MITSURU: That is amazing... It is unusual for someone to be so
calm before a battle.
YUKARI: Do you have a reason to fight, Main-kun?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: That's good. The next battle will be our last. Let's do
our best.
YUKARI: Well, don't worry. The next battle will be our last.
YUKARI: ...I hope you find one. The next battle will be our
last, so let's do our best.

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

AIGIS: When Akihiko-san began his runing program... I analyzed his time,
distance, and energy expended. Utilizing the overall results, I prepared
an optimal training regimen for him. He was so pleased with my
suggestions that he incorporated them into his regimen. I was so happy
to have been of service to him.
KEN: This may sound like a strange question, but I have to ask it. Am I being
helpful?
MAIN: 
KEN: Great! I want my mom and Shinjiro-san to be proud of me.
KEN: Then I will work harder. I want my mom and Shinjiro-san
to be proud of me...

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR, DAYTIME ===

JUNPEI: This might sound weird, but I just gotta ask... Will my time as a
superhero end when we're done fighting?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: That's what I thought... Well, that's fine with
me... It won't change the bond I have with Chidori.
I'll just enjoy being a superhero for as long as it
lasts!
JUNPEI: Whoa! Easy, dude! No need to be so harsh! Well, that's
fine with me... It won't change the bond I have with
Chidori. I'll just enjoy being a superhero for as long
as it lasts!
YUKARI: So, you're saying we're like heroes?
JUNPEI: Of course! We're saving the whole city, aren't we? Plus, if the
next mission goes well, we'll be undefeated! Now, do you see
my point?
YUKARI: Well... I never really thought of it that way, but I see your
point... I guess we better make sure we win the next battle.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

NERVOUS MAN: I-It's getting cold, huh? It's almost winter...
PATIENT WOMAN: Yeah, it's almost winter.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

FOOD GIRL: If you do something bad to the Sweet Shop's mascot, Azuki-chan...
You'll lose control of your bladder! She might be cute, but don't
think you can deface her!

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

AIGIS: Everyone's anxiety over Shinjiro-san's departure has subsided...
Everyone seems to be cherishing their lives much more than they did
before. Shinjiro-san's departure seems to have helped everyone grow and
mature.
AKIHIKO: There are two ways to prepare for battle... The first way is to get
all stressed out thinking about it. The second way is to turn your
nervousness into energy for training. I choose the second one. I'm
all about training. The more you train, the stronger you get. The
stronger you are, the better your chances of winning.
NARRATOR: On the next episode of Phoenix Ranger Featherman R!

peek into the female baths!?
NEWSCASTER: ...And now, the news. Apathy Syndrome continues to spread,
causing some to panic...

=== CLASS 2-F ===

MALE STUDENT: Dude, I went to the middle school to check out next year's
freshmen... and the cops came after me! Can you believe that?
I got away, but I didn't get to see if there were any hotties.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

NEWSCASTER: --comedian made an unexpectedly influential comment in a
sports magazine. His claim that Apathy Syndrome was
foretold by Nostradamus seems to be widely believed now...

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: Junpei-san seems to sleep a great deal. He must be conserving energy so
that he is prepared for combat. It is quite an interesting tactic.
JUNPEI: Just standing here, we seem like regular students, huh... No one would
ever guess we fight Shadows...

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

OLD MAN: Those youngsters who look all down in the mouth should try harder to
make some friends... What's that "net" thing they're got nowadays?
They probably don't even know how to talk to real people...
OFFICER KUROSAWA: So, your friend told me... this is the last battle. Well
then, prepare yourself as much as possible.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

NERVOUS MAN: I asked her on a date, but she said no, saying she didn't want to
go to town... Is it because it's getting cold, or is it something
I did...? Argh... I don't know...!
STALKER GIRL: God! This guy following me around just won't quit! He must be one
stubborn guy to follow anyone around that much. He'd make a great
detective...
STALKED BOY: Dude, did you see tha? She helped the cat that those brats were
picking on! Then she fed it some real high-class, gourmet cat
food! It's just a stray cat. Why's she making such a fuss over
it...?

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

SNOOPY REPORTER: All those Apathy Syndrome victims make me worried. If you look
at what's really going on... It's spreading through the entire
country, with more and more victims all the time. I wouldn't
be surprised if there's a major policy meeting about this
soon.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: SEES will most likely be disbanded after the final battle. I have so
many memories of my time in SEES... good ones... bad ones... What
about you? Did you enjoy participating in SEES?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: I hope you always remember the good time we shared
together.
MITSURU: Don't worry. I'm not offended. However, I would like
to thank you for all you've done.
FUUKA: The number of The Lost didn't decrease after the last operation...
But, we're almost done. Peace will return to this city soon. Let's
prepare for the final battle.
NEWSCASTER: The cultural anthropologists have announced more
information. One of them has accurately guessed the dates of
recoveries and relapses in the past... He believes that the
next wave of recovery will begin on the 7th.

=== CLUBS HALL ===

Cell-phone Student: Whaddya want? I'm playing an RPG on my cell, so buzz off.

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

Fortune-loving Girl: My friend fell victim to that Apathy Syndrome. I asked
Mama if she could help me. She said she can't "see" her,
so she can't do anything now...
Girl's Friend: Now does seem like the time to use fortune-telling... But I
wonder what she was trying to say. "Light will pierce the
shadow... Until then, have patience..."

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: The team's morale seems to be high. Yes, yes, that's very
good. I will be looking forward to celebrating our victory.
AIGIS: It seems like Koromaru-san can sense the change in how everyone feels.
The battles with Shadows are coming to an end... We will avenge the
death of Koromaru-san's owner in this next operation.
KEN: The end always makes people nervous... So, what about you, Main-san?
Are you nervous?
MAIN: 
KEN: Yeah, me too. When I think about the Dark Hour
disappearing... I get chills.
KEN: You're amazing... No wonder you're the leader. I get
chills when I think about the Dark Hour disappearing...
YUKARI: Do you think Koro-chan knows that this next operation will be our
last?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: So do I. Koro-chan has animal instincts.
YUKARI: Then, we should tell him... He will soon have revenge
for his owner...
JUNPEI: Koromaru is friggin' awesome, dude! He's not afraid of battling
Shadows, even though he's so small. I'm taking out the next Shadow for
Koromaru!
AKIHIKO: We haven't been going to Tartarus much lately. You should have a
better strength training regimen. We don't want to have any regrets,
so train as much as you can.

GIRLFRIEND: I'm waiting for my boyfriend... We're going to the drugstore in
Paulownia Mall to buy some skin care products. I don't want my skin
to age prematurely.

FITNESS EXPERT: Today's Cantonese word is "Kaumena"! Turn your head
left and right, and say it: "Kaumena!" "Kaumena" means
"Help!" Even I say "Kaumena" to those Apathy Syndrome
victims. That's all for this week! Back to the news!

=== FRONT GATE ===

CURIOUS STUDENT: Well, I can't find out anything else about the observatory.
So, that means one of two things... Either it's so mysterious
that there's nothing more I can learn about it... or it's not
mysterious at all, so there was nothing to learn about it in
the first place.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: Look around, man. We're surrounded by ordinary students. We could be
just like them next month, huh...

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

MATURE GIRL: My class won at Sports Day. We set a new record for jumping rope!
You think it's because our teacher put all his time into practice
every day...?

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

NEWSCASTER: Although cultural anthropologists have determined the dates
of attack and recovery... People are still concerned, since
no one has figured out the cause of the Syndrome.

=== CLUBS HALL ===

FEMALE STUDENT: Happy Henry Likes Beer...
MAIN: 
FEMALE STUDENT: Every teacher has his or her own personal
mnemonic for the first few elemetns in the
Periodic Table... The one our teacher taught us
is kind of raunchy, isn't it?
FEMALE STUDENT: You should study some more.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: ...... Sorry, I was thinking. I was wondering what will become of me
once we have defeated all the Shadows. I hope I can continue to attend
school.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: I don't think Strega will simply allow us to defeat the last Shadow.
They will either try to stop us outright, or secretly set a trap for
us. What do you think they will do, ?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Yes, I agree. They will most likely try to stop us
outright. Even if they were to set a trap, Yamagishi
would be able to detect.
MITSURU: Hmm... That is a possibility... We will need to rely
on Yamagishi to detect it, then.
AKIHIKO: Like Mitsuru said, we'll be facing Strega in our next battle... Well,
I'm actually looking forward to it. I'm going to give them hell in
return for what they did to Shinji.
FUUKA: The atmosphere is so tense. But, we should all try to relax... We'll
need to remain calm if we want to win the last battle.
AIGIS: I cannot understand the nervousness you all are feeling. But I know that
everyone will be giving their all in this battle... and so will I. This
will be the last time we fight, so we must do our very best.
JUNPEI: I've been so busy lately that I haven't been able to see Chidori...
Well, we're almost done. After we kill the last Shadow, I'm gonna go
straight to the hospital!
YUKARI: There's going to be a full moon soon, huh... I'm getting so nervous. I
need to stop thinking about it and just relax...
KEN: Strega might be planning something. But, I don't care... I'm going to
avenge Shinjiro-san...
NEWSCASTER: --autumn, the lights are beautiful. Particularly at the
Moonlight Bridge in Minato-ku...

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

FUUKA: The atmosphere of the dorm is so tense. But, we should all try to
relax... We'll need to remain calm if we want to win the last battle.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

JUNPEI: The next Shadow's the last one, right? Man, this one's going to be a
killer. We better bring the ultimate equipment for it!
AKIHIKO: I'm in great condition. All I need is some equipment to match, and I
can't lose.

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

SHUJI IKUTSUKI: Well, what would everyone like for their last meal?
I'm being ignored... Well, I guess they're too focused to
enjoy my jokes...
AIGIS: Ikutsuki-san seems to joke around a lot... But, I am unable to
understand his humor. My mind is already filled with thoughts... of the
last Shadow... the Dark Hour... and The Lost...
NARRATOR: On the next episode of Phoenix Ranger Featherman R!

VENDOR: Pick anything you like.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: Tomorrow will be the final battle. Are you ready? If not, you should
purchase the necessary equipment after school. Please make sure you are
well-prepared.
JUNPEI: Tomorrow's the day... I just know I'm not gonna be able to concentrate
in class... What about you?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Not good, bro. We better find a way to chill.
JUNPEI: Dude, how can you be so calm!? Well, I'll be counting
on you, man.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: Thank you for all you've done for us. Let's do our best in the last
battle.
JUNPEI: Hey, I almost forgot... Tomorrow's Culture Day. I'll probably just
stay home and rest, though... We've got the last operation coming up
soon.
KEN: This is it... I'm going to fight for my mom... and Shinjiro-san.
YUKARI: This will make Shadows disappear, right...? Along with the Dark Hour,
Tartarus, and everything else...? But, what my dad did...
NEWSCASTER: --if you're a Leo, then your lucky color is brown. For even
more luck, try removing a bookmark from a book you're still
reading!

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

SALARYMAN: I heard the rumor about Mr. Kirijo. To tell the truth, Mr. Kirijo
owned the company I used to work for, but... It's none of my
business now.
PHARMACY SHOPKEEPER: I've been seeing more people carry pill cases with them
lately. It's good to be prepared for any happenstance, but
it bothers me a little... They should carry their pills in
something a little more Japanese, y'know?
ANTIQUES OWNER: I heard the news... Kirijo-san passed away. But, there's no
need to talk about such things. So, how can I help you today?

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

FORTUNE TELLER: Would you like to know your fortune?
MAIN: 
FORTUNE TELLER: Very well... Under the fat crescent moon... A
feeble light at the hollow tower... A gunshot
rings out, shattering my vision into a thousand
pieces... I am sorry... I can see no further...
But I can say this... The shadow yet remains...
Farewell, then... May your future be bright...
FORTUNE TELLER: Come back any time...
WOMAN: Now that it's winter, I bet people are thinking of Christmas. But I bet
it's no sweat for you. How many dates have you got lined up?
MAN: Gekkoukan's chairman fell from the observatory while stargazing, right?
Doesn't something about that picture strike you as odd...? What do you
think?
MAIN: 
MAN: He liked stars, and now he became one... I just don't get
it.
MAN: But if it's a lie, it must be to cover something up, huh?
That's crazy, man! It's just like a movie!

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

FUUKA: We can't go to Tartarus tonight... I don't think anyone wants to go
anyways...
JUNPEI: Psh, we respected Ikutsuki so much, that shit-face. Dude, I'm so pissed
off. This would be a great time for one of those mind-erasers. I'm
never gonna trust another adult again.
AKIHIKO: Mitsuru is a very strong person inside. But, it's as if she just got
her insides ripped out. I hope she's alright...
YUKARI: I thought it would all be over by now... I don't understand... What're
we supposed to do now...?
KEN: What was Ikutsuki-san trying to say? He died before explaining the most
important thing... I never thought he would be capable of doing such a
thing.
NEWSCASTER: --shocked by the sudden death of the Kirijo Group
president. As a result of his death, an emergency meeting
has been called...

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: Mitsuru-san's father died from his illness, right? If my dad
died... I'd...
FEMALE STUDENT: Her father was a great person, but... Isn't this
overexaggerating? The president's just getting some attention.
Though I kind of feel sorry for her...
MITSURU ADMIRER: I heard Mitsuru-senpai's father passed away... It must be very
tough on her... I wish I could help her...
COMPLAINING GIRL: I told my parents what I wanted to do. I said I wanted to do
something related to fashion, and I'm going to school for
that. I knew they wouldn't agree with that... You could tell
by their faces.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

FAT STUDENT: It must suck being from such an influential family. I bet some
people aren't sad at all about what happened... They just want to
make a grab for power. By the way, did you know the Kirijo Group
built this school? I hope nothing bad happens...

=== ROOFTOP ===

FAT STUDENT: Man, Kirijo-san has it rough... First, her dad dies... Then, she
has to go to a meeting about the future of the Kirijo Group...
She's a real go-getter that one. I wish I could be like that.
...Ah, who am I trying to kid? I like being lazy.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

Short-Haired Housewife: H-Hey... Those motionless kids near the club... Are
they... Are they the ones with that Apathy Syndrome
everyone is talking about?
HOUSEWIFE WITH BRAIDS: Oh, you're worrying too much. Aren't they just
relaxing? Although... They have been like that
for a while. Are they going to stay there
forever...?
OLD MAN: This is the season where kids who don't have a sweetheart get all
lonely. I blame the cold. Just don't try your hand with too many girls
at once, or you could cause yourself some trouble.
GAMER STUDENT: Hmm... I can't get the timing down anymore... I'm so worried
about my friend that I can't concentrate.
OFFICER KUROSAWA: Well, it's not over yet... And it seems like the Kirijo Group
is in trouble as well... I wonder what's going to happen...
BE BLUE V SALESWOMAN: There's a student from Gekkoukan who comes over here to
stare at the accessories. If she likes them so much, I
better import her favorites!

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

SNOOPY REPORTER: Hmmm... Strange. The victims from that incident aren't going
away... Usually they disappear after the full moon, but...
Maybe something's changed, and I didn't notice? Well, whatever
it is, it doesn't seem good...
Movie-loving Man: It's the time of year when school couples come out to the
movies together. But what they don't know is that this
thriller has a love-story twist at the end! Man, you should
see the expressions on their faces as they come out! I almost
bust a gut laughing at it all! Heheheh!
STATION ATTENDANT: I was surprised to hear about Mr. Kirijo. Since the Kirijo
Group has a stake in this company, I'm worried about the
future. Though to tell you the truth, as long as I don't
lose my job, I don't really care what happens.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

TAXI DRIVER: My co-worker got into an accident. He's gotta wear a truss now.
I feel sorry for him. He can't work until his back heals, and
there's no workman's comp for us cabbies.
CAT: Hssss...!
Cat-obsessed Boy: That man and the lady... The old man and old lady, too...
Why are they just standing there, staring at nothing...? Are
they so tired that they don't want to do anything anymore?

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

FUUKA: Aigis has returned. I'm glad she doesn't have any problems. For whatever
reason, she tried to fight against us. I think it hurts her to be here
and see us... Can you please forgive her, Main-kun?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: Oh, thank you. I knew you were a kind person.
FUUKA: Oh, don't act like such a child! Act like a grown-up and
just forgive her!
YUKARI: Even if you believe in something, there's no guarantee it will always
be true... I wanted to stop believing so many times... But, I finally
feel good about it. Because, in my heart, my dad has always been my
dad.
AIGIS: I am truly sorry. Even though he took control of me, I cannot believe
I did such a thing to you... Can you ever forgive me?
MAIN: 
AIGIS: Thank you very much. I will train hard so that I can be
a great help to you.
AIGIS: ...Thank you very much. I will train hard so that I
can be a great help to you.
NEWSCASTER: --breaking news. Over the last 2 days, Apathy Syndrome has
spread even further. Everyone is disappointed, after the
announcement said it would begin to diminish around the
20th...

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: For some reason, I was unable to concentrate on the lesson. That is
very unlike me.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

NERVOUS MAN: Going to the mountains...? Did I really say that? But to really
get the mountain experience, we'll need two days and one night at
a hotel... I mean, no! No no no! We've got to get back before
sunset...!
PATIENT WOMAN: Since we couldn't go to the beach this summer, he suggested we
go to the mountains instead. So I reminded him, and, well...
He got like this. It's so like him...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

JUNPEI: I don't understand... What happened to Chidori...?

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

AKIHIKO: Mitsuru will be gone for a little while longer. Leaving her be is the
best thing right now, huh... I wish there was something more I could
do...
KEN: Mitsuru-senpai seems like she's having a very difficult time... She can't
seem to rely on any adults. Well, I guess that's because adults don't seem
to be very reliable these days.

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR, DAYTIME ===

FUUKA: I remember how Ikutsuki-san would tell the most horrible jokes all day
long... But, he was just pretending... That wasn't his true self. Do
you think he really enjoyed the times we all spent together...?
AIGIS: No one can answer that now...
YUKARI: Who cares? All we need to know is that he betrayed us... I'll
never forgive him for using my father...
FUUKA: ......
AIGIS: I will refer to him simply as "Ikutsuki" from now on. Ikutsuki never
mentioned anything about his plot, even when we were alone. Meaning, he
completely hid his true nature. It is truly an extraordinary feat.
This clearly illustrates how unique his psychological state was.
FUUKA: It's scary just thinking about it...
YUKARI: And all this time, we never suspected a thing... Ugh... It
makes me feel sick...
YUKARI: What are we gonna do...? Neither Tartarus nor the Dark Hour
disappeared... Only our reason for fighting is gone... Argh! This is
pissing me off! Damn you, Ikutsuki!
FUUKA: Calm down, Yukari-chan... Getting angry won't help the
situation.
AIGIS: That is correct. It is best if we erase him from our memories.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

GAMER STUDENT: I've decided to cut back on this and spend more time with my
friends. Just because we've grown a little distant doesn't mean
it's over. If I don't give up and keep talking to them, we'll be
back together in no time.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

STALKER GIRL: Is that guy who keeps following me around gonna talk to me or
what? No normal guy would be waiting this long to talk to a girl,
right?

crying! She actually made him stop that damn bawling! Damn...
She's one nice girl...

FEMALE STUDENT: Ryoji-kun from classroom F's parents are on vacation or
something. He's so hot... And so rich! Way out of my league...
FEMALE STUDENT: Class F's Ryoji-kun is soooo hot! You think he's teasing us?
I don't want to get played by him...
MITSURU ADMIRER: I hate this! I don't want to see Mitsuru-senpai so
depressed! Senpai! If there's anything I can do, I'd do
it at once! Even though I can't do much, I'll put my
all into supporting you! ...That's what I wish I could
bring myself to say to her face...
COMPLAING GIRL: Ryoji-kun seems a little different. He's got an exotic face...
No Japanese guy would ever look like that. I should have out
with him some weekend and get some fashion tips.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: Ryoji-san is dangerous. I have re-analyzed him and detect nothing out of
the ordinary. However, I have a "bad feeling" about him.
JUNPEI: Ryoji seems kinda mysterious, doesn't he? Ya know, I thought the same
thing about you the first time I saw ya. You, Aigis, and now Ryoji. For
some reason, everyone who joins this class seems that way.
RYOJI: Hey, you must be Main-kun, right? Nice to meet you. Wow, I never dreamed
there would be so many cute girls at this school. I've already asked
many of them out on dates.

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

FORTUNE TELLER: Would you like to know your fortune?
MAIN: 
FORTUNE TELLER: Very well... Oh...? Is this a new friend...?
How mystifying... No one can see into his
essence... No one, save for one girl...
Farewell, then... May your future be bright...
FORTUNE TELLER: Come back any time...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

FUUKA: Um, what was his name...? Ryoji...? Ryoji Mochizuki? Yes, that's it. I
saw him in the hallway. He is very strange...
JUNPEI: Man, that Ryoji Mochizuki sure is cool. He's got all the girls lovin'
him... I'm glad I finally have a rival that can stand up to my good
looks!
AIGIS: Be careful of Ryoji-san... There is something about him... I don't know
exactly what, though.
YUKARI: I don't like how Ryoji-kun hits on all the girls... Well, he's pretty
good looking, so a lot of them probably don't mind. Unlike Junpei, who
couldn't get a girl if he was the last guy on the planet.
JUNPEI: I heard that, Yuka-tan! How dare you say something like that
about this hunk of burning love!
YUKARI: ...Hunk of what?
NEWSCASTER: --questions directed to the cultural anthropologist.
According to his hypothesis, the current wave of Apathy
Syndrome was due to end on the 20th. However, with the
Syndrome spreading even further, his trust has been...

=== CLASS 2-F ===

MALE STUDENT: Dude! That new transfer student is a total chick magnet! Just
because he's different... Man, it's so unfair...

center of attention. But, Ryoji-kun seems to be enjoying it.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

KEN: I lost a parent, so I know how Mitsuru-senpai feels. I don't exactly know
how I got over it, but... I still remember how I shut myself away from the

AKIHIKO: Mitsuru has finally returned, but...  She's still bummed... I
guess she needs more time.

=== CLUBS HALL ===

Cell-phone Student: RPGs aren't that bad on cell phones... One game lasts for a
pretty long time, so I guess I'll play it a little while
longer.
FEMALE STUDENT: The other day, I saw something weird on the Internet. It was a
high school chemistry forum that said they put a container of
water in the middle of the school... They dropped in 1 mol of
sodium, causing a huge explosion. Too bad it wasn't filmed...
I would have like to see it.

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

Fortune-loving Girl: I went out to eat the other day, but I forgot to check
my fortune beforehand. So I couldn't decide what to order.
I started to sweat... Good thing they had a magazine with
a fortune-telling column.
Girl's Friend: That stuff about not being able to order food without her
fortune... She's just kidding, right? Oh my God... That's not
good.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

SNOOPY REPORTER: Mr. Kirijo passed away. Officially, it was from an illness,
but... I'd be no reporter if I just believed the official
story! There's something going on here... I heard a rumor that
it might have been murder.
Movie-loving Man: Gekkoukan's chairman died from falling from the
observatory... Usually, it's the bad guys who tend to die by
falling from a high place, but... That can't be right. I
guess I've been watching too many movies. I should be praying
for him...

FOOD GIRL: You only get the special miso soup if you order the Fried Shrimp
set. I hear that sometime, you'll find a real pearl in that soup!
CAT: Meww...?
Cat-obsessed Boy: My mom said I can't have a cat, no matter what. But it's
okay. My dad is on my side! I'm gonna learn all about cats,
and show her I can take care of one... Then my dad will
convince my mom! I'll do my best!

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

YUKARI: Ryoji-kun transferred at such a weird time. Maybe it was because of his
parents... No one knows anything about him. He's so mysterious...
JUNPEI: Who's mysterious? Ryoji? Psh! That's just his M.O. He's just trying to
get the ladies interested in him by being secretive. He's just a
normal, good-looking guy. ...Like me!
NEWSCASTER: --doctors working multiple shifts due to the number of
patients. With some doctors succumbing to Apathy Syndrome
themselves, the situation is worsening...

MITSURU: Sorry, but I won't be able to go to Tartarus for a while...
I can't seem to find a reason to fight... Or a reason to live, for
that matter...

JUNPEI: Sometimes, I start heading to the hospital without even realizing it...
Today was one of those days.  Chidori... Why'd she...?

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

Short-haired Housewife: I heard the head of the Kirijo Group passed away...
His young daughter is all alone in the world now. He
must regret having to leave her so early.
HOUSEWIFE WITH BRAIDS: Well, officially, his death was an accident.
But judging by his fierce face... I think it was
foul play. Maybe it was gang-related...?
OLD MAN: Don't be too hesitant to mix it up at a club. You could meet some new
people! Those Mrs. Grundys at the PTA would give me a dirty look for
saying so, but you should dance till sunrise!

MATURE GIRL: Our teacher came to life for Spots Day, but now he's back to

he's like a different person.

AIGIS: I have thought long and hard about Ryoji-san... And I still don't know
exactly what it is about him... But, I want you to remain cautious
around him.
FITNESS EXPERT: Today's Cantonese word is "Chinyan"! Make a heart with
your hands and say, "Chinyan!" "Chinyan" means "Lover."
If you catch Apathy Syndrome, you won't be "Chinyan"
amymore! That's all for this week! Back to the news!

GIRLFRIEND: I'm waiting for my boyfriend... We're going to the Sweet Shop at
the strip mall.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: The manner in which this school conducts its field trips is unusual, is
it not? First year students do not normally go on a trip, but for some
reason the seniors have not gone on one either. So this year, the
juniors and seniors are going together.
RYOJI: The school trip is coming up... Aren't you excited?
MAIN: 
RYOJI: I'll make sure we have a great time while we're there...
RYOJI: Oh, come on... It'll be fun.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

KEN: Unfortunately, I can't go with you guys on the school trip... so please
bring me back a souvenir. Oh, and I'd prefer something other than a
t-shirt or a key chain. I hear they have really good nama-yatsuhashi
there...
FUUKA: I'm really worried about Mitsuru-senpai... When she gets depressed, then
Akihiko-senpai gets depressed, too. I hope the school trip will cheer
her up...
YUKARI: Hey, I heard we're going to Kyoto for the class trip. I just love
Kyoto...
NEWSCASTER: --today's exchange rate. The yen is now 115.52 to the

MITSURU: ... I saw your exam results... Good work. That's quite an
accomplishment, considering all you've had to juggle. Here's a reward
for your hard work...

RYOJI: Hmm, what did I do wrong...? Is that not her style? Mitsuru-san seems
like a tough nut to crack...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: Are you excited about the trip, ?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Well, I hope it will be a memorable trip.
MITSURU: You don't need to worry about my feelings... I hope
you enjoy your trip.
AKIHIKO: So, we're going to Tartarus, huh? She may not be worried... but that
doesn't mean I'm not worried.
FUUKA: Did you know...? Yukari-chan used to live in Kyoto.
MAIN: 
FUUKA: Maybe we can ask her to be our tour guide. ...Or would
that be rude?
FUUKA: I didn't know either until I asked her directly. So, she
might not be happy that the school trip is to Kyoto...
YUKARI: I used to live in Kyoto, you know. It's funny how everyone has these
stereotypes of that place... especially Junpei. He's running around
yelling, "Geishas, geishas!"
JUNPEI: Hey, I heard Yuka-tan was born in Kyoto... Is that true!? Dude, I can't
picture Yuka-tan wearing a kimono and playing the shamisen... Not in
a million years!
AIGIS: I am unable to understand the significance of a "trip". I thought that
it was simply an activity to experience, but it seems to be more complex
than that. What do you obtain when you go on a "trip"?
MAIN: 
AIGIS: Memories... What do you benefit from gaining memories?
...It is very difficult.
AIGIS: That is the biggest difference between us. I am always
able to explain the motives of my actions... ......

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR, DAYTIME ===

JUNPEI: Akihiko-san is going through a tough time, too... This is not good,
man. What if the seniors decide to quit SEES? I don't know if we can
handle it without them, man.
KEN: Junpei-san! Don't say that!
KOROMARU: 
KEN: Mitsuru-senpai and Akihiko-senpai have been leading us all this time, and
even they don't know what to do...  What's going to happen...?
KOROMARU: Woof! Woof!
KEN: You're probably saying, "Don't worry," right Koromaru? You're such
a brave dog.
AKIHIKO: Mitsuru is still not herself, and I don't know what we should do...
Dammit! How long is this gonna continue!?

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: Most of the people I meet seem nervous. Are you nervous, Main?
MAIN: 
AIGIS: That's good. You're just like everyone else, then.
AIGIS: You seem calm. Perhaps you should be a little more
nervous...
AIGIS: I don't know. Do I seem like I am?
JUNPEI: Well, tomorrow's the day... Lately, it seems like everything we talk
about is so depressing. Why don't we have some fun? Come on, whaddya
say?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Yeah, baby. That's the spirit.
JUNPEI: Cheer up, dide. Just follow your instincts! We need to
liven things up around here.
RYOJI: Tomorrow, we leave for our trip... I can't wait.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

SNOOPY REPORTER: When I was looking into Mr. Kirijo's death, there's one thing
that bothered me. The chairman of the board, Shuji Ikutsuki.
He was found dead with Mr. Kirijo at the observatory... And
he's known Mr. Kirijo since they were in the Kirijo Group
together. I wish I could put my finger on it...
SALARYMAN: I saw one of my old coworkers a while ago, and asked how he's
holding up after the restructuring. He's been reduced to nothing but
a yes-man for his managers and bosses. I know having a job is
important, but don't sacrifice your self-worth for it... Especially
not young kids like you. Tell your classmates what you really think,
and form lasting friendships.

AKIHIKO: Mitsuru finally decided to go on the trip with us. I was really
worried she wouldn't.
JUNPEI: In this world, there are things you just can't change. So, it's better
to focus on those things you can change. Got that, bro? Alright, then!
Let's have an awesome time on the school trip!
FEMALE REPORTER: Hi, I'm Trish, with today's installment of "Who's

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR ===

YUKARI: At least a trip will give us a chance to clear our heads... But, that
won't make things any easier...
AIGIS: But, a school trip is a rare event. It would be a shame to miss
it.
YUKARI: Yeah, I guess.
FUUKA: I know it's going to be hard, but we should all try to be happy. The
school trip won't be any fun if everyone's sad... I want to look back
on this trip with fond memories...
YUKARI: I understand how you feel... ......
AIGIS: I understand how important a school trip is for everyone... but I don't
think it will help us decide what to do. It's just a chance to relax for
a while.
FUUKA: That's not necessarily true, Aigis...
YUKARI: I wonder when the answer will become clear...

=== GODAIGO, 1ST FLOOR ===

JUNPEI: Wahaha, did ya see that!? I was so close... but I got caught. We better
go to our room, man... or else Ms. Toriumi might get pissed off.
RYOJI: Did you know the hot spring here is really famous? Every few hours,
there's a surprise.
MS. TORIUMI: Hurry hurry hurry hurry! You can talk later! Hurry up and get to
your rooms. I don't want to be yelled at for your behavior!
...Huh? Don't you know which room you're in?
MAIN: 
MS. TORIUMI: Umm, Main-kun... To get to your room... Go up the
stairs and turn right. Your room will be on the
right-hand side at the end of the hall. Got it?
Now, go.
MS. TORIUMI: Hurry up and go.
MALE SENIOR: The Student Council President seems like she's mad. Does she think
we're being immature?
MALE JUNIOR: You don't read the newspaper, do you Senpai? Her father recently
died... Wait, you seriously didn't know?

=== GODAIGO, 2ND FLOOR ===

AKIHIKO: Even though we're at an inn far away from home, it feels just like the
dorm. I should just get some sleep and hope we'll have time for sight-
seeing tomorrow.
MALE STUDENT: If I knew we'd be trapped in our rooms, I'd have brought some
board games...
MALE STUDENT: Everyone says tomorrow is the ordinary sightseeing. What's so
ordinary about it...? Well, I'll just follow along and see for
myself.
MALE STUDENT: I can't sleep with a pillow that isn't mine...
MALE STUDENT: Whoa, I didn't know they aired this show in Kyoto, too. Back
home, it airs on Sunday afternoons... I feel like I'm watching
a different program.
MALE STUDENT: Hmmm? Do I have my yukata on straight...? It doesn't seem
right...
MALE STUDENT: I reserved this mattress specially. This corner is the best
one...
MALE STUDENT: We're visiting shrines tomorrow... Honestly, why bother? I think
I'll fake sick and relax in here tomorrow instead.
STUDENT BY THE SLIDING DOOR: How come our school trip is inside Japan? Dude,
we've gotta go abroad or there's no point!
STUDENT BY THE ENTRANCE: I hear it's Ekoda's fault. Every other teacher
wanted to go out of the country, but Ekoda
insisted on Kyoto.
STUDENT BY THE SLIDING DOOR: Serious? That guy sucks...

=== GODAIGO, 3RD FLOOR ===

MITSURU: ......
FEMALE STUDENT: Hey, do you have anyone to go around with tomorrow? Wait a
second... Are you going out with someone?
MAIN: 
FEMALE STUDENT: Aww... Bummer. But if you've got a girlfriend,
you shouldn't leave her behind at times like
this. Girls get really mad when you do that,
you know...
FEMALE STUDENT: Really? Are you just trying to make up your
mind which one you want? I wish I had someone
cool-looking, so I wouldn't be as bored...
FEMALE STUDENT: Ugh, that's no fun... Way to kill the
conversation there.
FEMALE STUDENT: Kinkakuji? Kiyomizudera? Are you kidding me...? If we're in
Kyoto, we've gotta go to Shinsengumi! That's what I'm talking
about! Iketaya's remains... And the Nishihonganji, right?
Nooo... I won't have enough time!

=== GODAIGO, 1ST FLOOR ===

JUNPEI: I bet Mitsuru-senpai is having a hard time. If I was her, I wouldn't
be having much fun, either.
RYOJI: Beautiful scenery, beautiful women... Kyoto is the place to be.
FEMALE STUDENT: How y'all been doin'? Ahahahaha. How do you like my Kyoto
accent? Pretty good, huh?
FEMALE STUDENT: I underestimated Kyoto... There are so many places to go!
Now, what should I do tomorrow...?
MALE STUDENT: I'm gonna get nama-yatsuhashi as a souvenir... Hey, did you
know...? Regular yatsuhashi is baked.

=== GODAIGO, 2ND FLOOR ===

AKIHIKO: It seems like Mitsuru's overcome her pain. I don't know what happened,
but as long as she's feeling better, I'm relieved.
MALE STUDENT: I'm so tired of touring shrines and stuff. I'm sick of this
touristy stuff...  I should sneak out later to hit the
arcade...
MALE STUDENT: Tomorrow's the last day of the trip... I should find somewhere
else to sightsee.
MALE STUDENT: I was worried about not being able to sleep, but I slept like a
log last night! This is one fine inn! Their cushions are world-
class!
MALE STUDENT: Did you check out the souvenir shop downstairs? 6HARA is a pretty
weird name for it!
MALE STUDENT: There were doodles all over my face when I woke up this
morning... In oil-based ink! This is pathetic! I'll get my
revenge if I have to stay up all night...
MALE STUDENT: I tried to go to the girls' room at midnight yesterday, but the
teacher was guarding the stairs. How am I going to get up
there...?
STUDENT BY THE ENTRANCE: Man, this spa is huge! It felt so good that I swam
around. Yes! One lap down!
STUDENT BY THE SLIDING DOOR: Dude, just because it's big doesn't mean
you should swim in it.

=== GODAIGO, 3RD FLOOR ===

FUUKA: I saw Yukari-chan and Mitsuru-senpai talking to each other. It seemed
strange for them to be so cheerful together that way...
AIGIS: I just saw Yukari-san and Mitsuru-san entering their room together.

MALE STUDENT: Dude, do you think we can sneak a peek while the women are at
the hot springs?
MAIN: 
MALE STUDENT: Yeah, I'm sure there's no way.
MALE STUDENT: Are you serious!? ...But, I wouldn't want to get
caught or anything.
MALE STUDENT: Don't do anything stupid, okay?

=== GODAIGO, 2ND FLOOR ===

AKIHIKO: Junpei was looking for you downstairs. What's up?
RYOJI: The hot spring is so relaxing...
MALE STUDENT: I've gotta studdy my ass off for the examsn when I get back...
The university entrance exams are in less than 2 months. The
competition's about to begin.
FEMALE STUDENT: Why'd you have to remind me about the exams...? Way to
kill the trip's mood.
MALE STUDENT: I was kicked out of my room because I was annoying my
roommates... It's irritating just to talk about it. When I get
back, I'm gonna bother them even more than before.
MALE STUDENT: My bag's cluttered inside, since I just threw my clothes in at
random... I'd better take care not to leave any undies behind.
People will wonder who left them... Especially Ekoda! I can just
see him asking everyone when we gather at the station.
MALE STUDENT: H-Hey, don't come in my room without my permission!
FEMALE STUDENT: Umm... Can I have some privacy, please...?

=== GODAIGO, 3RD FLOOR ===

FEMALE STUDENT: Yukari and Mitsuru-senpai have such good figures.. The exercise
they get in their club must naturally shape their bodies.
FEMALE STUDENT: That Yamagishi girl has a good figure too! I was surprised when
I saw her at the baths yesterday. But she's in the Culture
club... Does that mean one's club has nothing to do with one's
figure?

=== HOT SPRINGS MINIGAME ===

JUNPEI: I can't believe this is happening... This is messed up, dude.
AKIHIKO: This is NOT good... We have to do something!
RYOJI: I think we should just come clean and apologize.

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

MAN: Hey, how's tricks?
MAIN: 
MAN: I'm so jealous of you, man... I bet you've got a
girlfriend. You'll do fine over Christmas if you've got
somebody.
MAN: I see... I can't catch a groove either. I guess it'll be
a lonely Christmas for us two dudes. Just like every
year...
WOMAN: All those new couples at school... They make fun of me for being single.
The only thing to do is to dance like there's no tomorrow! It's groovy
being single!

=== DORM LOUNGE (LOST HOT SPRING GAME) ===

MITSURU: Kyoto is filled with many beautiful sights. But, the place I liked
best was Kamogawa, especially at nighttime. The sunset was absolutely
amazing. I will never forget it. Hm? The execution? Yes, I remember.
Would you like another?
FUUKA: ......
FUUKA: Just a reminder... Everyone is tired from the trip, so we're
not going to explore Tartarus tonight. See you tomorrow...
AIGIS: You are unscrupulous. As a penalty, I shall not converse with you for
the rest of the day. Commencing ignore mode.
YUKARI: I used to live in Kyoto, so I've been to most of the tourist
attractions... but I've never seen the sunset at the Kamogawa. It was
so beautiful. ...I hope you've thought about what you did. Don't worry,
I'm not mad anymore... But, I still think you should thank us for
punishing you guys... We saved you from making the same mistake in the
future.
KEN: Thank you for the souvenir! By the way... It seems like you guys are
uncomfortable around the girls... I can't imagine why you should be...
JUNPEI: Hm? Kyoto? ...... I don't remember anything about it.
AKIHIKO: ...I'll say this... The principal offenders were Junpei and Ryoji.
We were forced to commit the crime, against our will. We were victims
too. ...... Now, please do not mention it ever again.

=== DORM LOUNGE (WON HOT SPRING GAME) ===

MITSURU: Kyoto is filled with many beautiful sights. But, the place I liked
best was Kamogawa, especially at nighttime. The sunset was absolutely
amazing. I will never forget it.
FUUKA: Everyone's exhausted. There's no way we can go to Tartarus tonight.
The school trip was so much fun! We visited so many beautiful places...
and I really enjoyed the hot spring. Which reminds me, we heard
something when we were soaking. It was probably just some monkeys. Are
you alright, Main-kun? You're sweating...
YUKARI: I used to live in Kyoto, so I've been to most of the tourist
attractions... but I've never seen the sunset at the Kamogawa. It was
so beautiful.
AIGIS: What is the matter, Main-san? You seem anxious when the girls are
around. I speculate that you are concealing a serious matter from the
girls.
KEN: Thank you for the souvenir! By the way... It seems like you guys are
uncomfortable around the girls... I can't imagine why you should be...
JUNPEI: Memories...? We sure had a rough time in the hot spring, huh? Why
couldn't it have been some girls we didn't know?
AKIHIKO: You guys should feel lucky. If we'd gotten caught... ...... we
would've experienced hell on earth...

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

MITSURU ADMIRER: Mitsuru-senpai has cheered up a little, which is good, but...
I still feel awkward. I couldn't help her at all...
COMPLAINING GIRL: I HATE my stupid parents! They said anyone who doesn't
graduate from a four-year college has no future! That's
discrimination against the undereducated!
MAIN: 
COMPLAINING GIRL: You agree, right? I'm not going to back down
to them this time.
COMPLAINING GIRL: Is that really so...?

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: Deciding on one's career seems to be a fascinating process. However,
since I am designed primarily for battle, it is useless for me.
JUNPEI: Man, why did we have to come to school today?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: We should've had today off...
JUNPEI: But, it's the day after the School Trip! We need time
to unpack our bags and stuff. And I'm still tired,
too...
RYOJI: That trip was a blast... especially the hot springs... Oops, sorry. That
was supposed to be a secret, wasn't it? But sharing secrets is fun, too.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

Short-haired Housewife: Your daughter is looking wonderful lately. She came
over to say hi to me, and I didn't recognize her. Is
she getting married? Or did she just get a boyfriend?
HOUSEWIFE WITH BRAIDS: Oh, it's nothing like that... Do you see the
Chagall coffeeshop next to the club? My daughter
said that just drinking their coffee increases
your Charm. It's pheremones, or something...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: The saying "Earnest labor brings happiness is simply a pretext.
However, there are some people, like Yukari's father, who put their
whole lives into their work. At any rate, this will be a great
opportunity to learn about the workforce. Good luck.
FUUKA: I know none of us want to do it, but we just have to get it over with.
Just think of it in an exercise in endurance. You can do that, can't
you?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: Then, let's do our best.
FUUKA: Well, everyone has to participate in Career Experience,
so let's just try to do our best.
YUKARI: Work... My dad did his very best... He was a hard worker, and he never
complained... Well, that was that, and this is this.
KEN: Another event I can't take part in. I've never heard of Career
Experience before. Do you think it'll be fun?
MAIN: 
KEN: It doesn't seem like you want to participate in Career
Experience. Well, I hope it's not too boring.
KEN: I agree. It'll probably be boring.
JUNPEI: Career Experience, huh... Who thought this crap up? We don't need to
experience how boring work is. Man, this school sucks.
AKIHIKO: Boring work, huh? Well, too bad... Quit complainging and do your job.

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR ===

AIGIS: I can't stop thinking about Ryoji-san. I am worried I may overheat. I
even asked Koromaru-san for help...
KOROMARU: Woof?

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

JUNPEI: Lemme ask you somethin'... Let's say your lady told you she didn't want
you to visit her anymore, but you really want to see her. What would
you do?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Yeah, that's what I thought. But, what if she gets
pissed again? Do you think she'll end our relationship?
I mean, I don't want that to happen...
JUNPEI: Yeah, you're right... But, nothing will change if I
don't see her again... Dude, I don't know what to do...
AIGIS: Career Experience appears to be routine labor that is performed over and
over again. That doesn't bother me... but everyone else seems to
despise it.
YUKARI: Tomorrow is Labor Day, so we get it off. But, Career Experience starts
right after that...  Bummer, huh?

STALKER GIRL: That guy who's been following me... Is he blushing? Umm, am I

STATION ATTENDANT: Those people in town are like statues. Though, since they
don't stop the trains or cause any trouble... I prefer them
to the gangs at that spot.

FUUKA: Senpai won't be back until late. So, we shouldn't go to Tartarus
tonight.
JUNPEI: Hey, what's gonna happen to Chidori? She's in the hospital now, but...
where's she gonna go when she leaves? I'm so worried about her.
NEWSCASTER: We interrupt Phoenix Ranger Featherman R for this special
bulletin. It seems that someone threw an explosive device
into the Tatsumi Memorial Hospital last night. Police
suspect a crazed member of one of the Apathy Syndrome
victims' families, and...

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

AKIHIKO: I haven't seen Junpei around... but I know he's going to be okay.
KEN: I wonder what Strega is... They couldn't have come from nowhere; someone
must have created them. I wonder what that person was thinking... Couldn't
he foresee that this would happen?
AIGIS: The top priority of all living beings... is the preservation of their
own lives. But, Chidori-san gave her life force to Junpei-san. There was
a connection between them that transcended space and time.
FUUKA: Junpei-kun and Chidori-san were so close. I know they're still
"together" now... But, I never thought it would end like this...
MITSURU: She was taking those drugs as well. If she hadn't died now, she most
likely would have died soon. But Fate chose the most beautiful way
to end her life.
YUKARI: She was the first girl Junpei's ever been serious about... Do you think
he'll be okay...?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Oh, I'm glad to hear that.
YUKARI: Oh, don't say that. You're making me nervous...

Farewell, then... May your future be bright...
FORTUNE TELLER: Come back any time...

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

NEWSCASTER: More details on the explosive that was thrown into Tatsumi
Memorial Hospital... Miraculously, no one was killed or
wounded, but one patient is presently unaccounted for...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: There's a saying, "Time heals all wounds." Do you think that applies
to Iori? A few days have already passed, but he still seems the same.
Should we just give him more time? Or should we try to help him?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: You're right... His loved one is dead. It's going to
take longer than just a few days for him to get over
that.
MITSURU: You're right... He needs help. But, what should we do?
FUUKA: Junpei-kun never showed up for Career Experience... He must have gone
somewhere... What if Junpei-kun never recovers from this...?
AIGIS: ...... Career Experience was interesting... I performed routine labor,
over and over again.
YUKARI: Career Experience totally wiped me out. That, and what happened to
Junpei... Speaking of which, I wonder if he's going to be okay...
KEN: How was Career Experience?
MAIN: 
KEN: Oh, it's too bad Junpei-san didn't attend, then. It
would've made him happy again. ...On second thought, it
probably wouldn't have been that easy...
KEN: No wonder Junpei-san didn't attend Career Experience...
I hope he recovers soon.
AKIHIKO: He knows what he needs to do. He's just afraid to do it. I think all
he needs is a little push.
NEWSCASTER: --update on the missing patient from yesterday... There
seems to be a high likelihood that the girl was kidnapped
by the culprit who threw the explosives...

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: Junpei-san went home early today. He was walking quite fast. Perhaps he
has not fully recovered from the incident. I am concerned...

he's a great astronaut.

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

Fortune-loving Girl: Remember when I told you how I forgot to check my fortune,
and started to sweat? Now I check my fortune first thing
in the morning, after I wake up. If I forget to check
it... I can't get through the day without sweating.
Girl's Friend: She can't go through the day without her fortune...? This is
bordering on addiction. What should I do? Maybe I should ask
Mama... Wait, wouldn't it be weird to get a fortune-teller's
advice on shaking an addiction to fortune-telling? Now I'm
really lost...

MITSURU: Even though she was an avant-garde artist, she left a sketch book

MITSURU: Good. Don't forget it.
MITSURU: Well, it's very important, so take some time and think
about it.
FUUKA: Even though Natsuki-chan and I are apart, our bond lives on. I think the
same is true for Junpei-kun and Chidori-san. Chidori-san has passed
away, but her bond with Junpei-kun will last forever.
AIGIS: The recovery of Junpei-san's mental health has been confirmed... Wait,
did that sound strange? Let me try again... I have comfirmed that
Junpei-san's mental state has returned to normal.
YUKARI: Junpei looked like a different person in that drawing...
KEN: She drew a picture of him in her sketchbook, huh... That sounds like a
scene in a romance novel. Anyway, I'm glad that Junpei-san is himself
again.
JUNPEI: Hey, who's that hot guy in that sketch book? Chidori might have touched
it up a little... But, pretty soon I'm gonna look just like him! Wait
and see.
AKIHIKO: Heh... Now, that's the Junpei I know.

no idea, either...
KOROMARU:

liking him or disliking him. There is just something about
him...

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: Career Experience the other day was sooo boring... Just the
same stuff, over and over again. I should have just ditched.
I would have had more fun sitting in class and doing nothing...
FEMALE STUDENT: Career Experience... That's all about, like, seeing for
yourself what a real job is like, right? I'm doing a part-time
job already, though... It's a secret to the school, but... I
already know everything I need to know to enter society. How
can they make us work for free!?

MALE STUDENT: Dude, I was looking forward to meeting some babes on that trip.
But, I guess it wasn't meant to be. Our school has the hottest

FAT STUDENT: So many things happened during the school trips... People got all

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: Ryoji-san was absent today as well... I wonder what happened?
JUNPEI: He's prolly sick or somethin'. It's been cold lately. Or, maybe
he met a hot chick on the way to school and decided to go out

FUUKA: Are you saying it's just my imagination? Well, I hope
you're right...
YUKARI: Aigis didn't like Ryoji-kun from the moment she met him. Do you think
it's because they just don't get along?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: It's probably because he's always flirting. To be
honest, I don't really like him that much either.
YUKARI: Yeah, you're right. It's none of my business.
KEN: Everyone's studying for their exams... but make sure you don't tire

SALARYMAN: I was a little tipsy yesterday at midnight, and
ended up at the gang spot. I thought kids were too
cool to steal from middle-aged men now... But they
beat me until I could barely talk anymore. What kind
of society is so vicious to its weaker element? I
feel like I've lost the will to live...

the Deliverance, or something... I don't understand adults.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: We should organize the information we already have. Is there anything
you would like to know?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: After the incident, Aigis was taken to the laboratory.
The researchers are tending to her. But with the
injuries she sustained, it's going to take a while.
MITSURU: Aigis lost her memories of the battle she waged with
Ryoji Mochizuki ten years ago... However, I believe
she still sensed that he was a Shadow... an incredibly
strong Shadow she had fought before...
MITSURU: That is an excellent quiestion. Ryoji Mochizuki is a
Shadow... The same Shadow Aigis sealed inside you, ten
years ago. Over those ten years, that Shadow
changed... It gained the appearance and
characteristics of a human being. And that is why it
gave us a "choice".
FUUKA: I don't think anyone really cares about exploring Tartarus... Um, is
there something you want to ask me?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: ...According to Ryoji-kun, the reason was because of
your existance... You came here with Ryoji-kun inside
you, bringing us all together... as well as the Shadows
that had been dispersed to different locations.
FUUKA: Ten years ago... you happened to be present when Aigis
and Ryoji-kun were fighting. Aigis couldn't defeat
Ryoji-kun, so she decided to seal him inside you. ......
What a tragic fate...
FUUKA: When you moved here... Ryoji-kun began to awaken... and
the 12 Shadows appeared.
YUKARI: Everyone just needs some time... We're all confused, and we need to
make sense of what happened...
MAIN: 
YUKARI: He said it's impossible... Nyx is death itself, so we
can't avoid it... or defeat it.
YUKARI: ...If we let Ryoji-kun live, we'll have to face Nyx.
...And he said that Nyx is undefeatable. S-So then, how
can we win...?
YUKARI: The coming of the Fall may be delayed by a little...
but our memories related to the Dark Hour will
disappear... It may be the easiest way, but I don't
think I can do it...
YUKARI: I don't know... but I won't run away...
KEN: I was hoping this was all just a bad dream... I remember the other time
I wished everything was a dream... ......
JUNPEI: Stupid Ryoji... Saying the world is going to end out of nowhere... The
Appriser!? What the hell does that mean, anyway?
AKIHIKO: ...We have to stay calm. If we panic, we won't be able to make the
right choice. ...We have to think about what's going on...
MAIN: 
AKIHIKO: Shadows are pieces of Nyx... amd their sole reason of
existance is to revive her.
AKIHIKO: ...The Apprise is the one who summons Nyx. The
appearance of The Appriser is a sign that the Fall is
near... and all humans will become members of The
Lost. ...I guess everything that's happening right now
is just the beginning.
AKIHIKO: According to Ryoji, it was Nyx who brought death to
this plant. ...Nyx will turn every human being into
a member of The Lost... and we'll all die.

HOUSEWIFE WITH BRAIDS: Is that the place that uses the mysterious

inedible... But I wouldn't be able to eat there.
I don't have the courage those kids have to try

FUUKA: ...I wanted to hear Natsuki-chan's voice, so I called her... She seemed
to know there was something wrong... But, I just couldn't tell her that
the world is going to end soon... What should I do...?

Ryoji-kun was talking about... So, they must've known something about
the Fall...
YUKARI: It gives me a bad feeling, though... It feels like we're being
laughed at...
MITSURU: ...I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about that. Let's just
concentrate on Nyx for now.
MITSURU: I just got a report from the laboratory. Apparently, Aigis can be
repaired... but they don't know exaclty how long it will take.
FUUKA: I see... She was seriously damaged... So, I'm relieved to hear
that.
YUKARI: Yeah... I hope she can come back soon.
YUKARI: I wonder what Ryoji-kun is doing right now... He seemed the most upset
about the world coming to an end. Worrying about him won't change
anything, though...
FUUKA: .....
MITSURU: Right. He doesn't look forward to the Fall, either. I'm sure
he wants the same thing we do...

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

SNOOPY REPORTER: It happened again! I got warned by the boss just for gathering

MITSURU: ...You're a very interesting person.
FUUKA: I've been just studying in my room... so I don't have to think about

FUUKA: I was thinking about the connection between what Ikutsuki-san and
Ryoji-kun both told us... And then, everything finally made sense.
Ikutsuki-san made us fight the 12 Shadows in hopes that The Appriser
would return... And by doing so, he managed to fuse Ryoji-kun, who was
inside you, with the 12 Shadows. And that's when Ryoji-kun appeared to
us as The Appriser, in a completed form.

Just kidding. I'll manage.
FAT STUDENT: Christmas sucks, man. Behind all those presents, there's a vicious
sales war raging. I wonder how many people commit suicide during
Christmas.
MALE STUDENT: Dude, have you noticed? Around Christmas time, people flirt like
crazy... And the magazines are filled with sappy pictures. Isn't
that overkill? Man, I wish this year Santa would bring me a
girlfriend...
FEMALE STUDENT: That was a hard test. I'm not sure how I did. I guess I'll have
to wait for the scores to be posted.
MALE STUDENT: Hmmm, how should I explain this...? I feel like I'm climbing a
mountain without a rope... Oh man, my stomach hurts...

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

GAMER STUDENT: It's probably because of the holiday season, but it's so noisy
here. I can't concentrate... M-My coins...!
PHARMACY SHOPKEEPER: I got a great type of carrot from Ken-chan, my wholesaler.
He said if you feed it to someone's wife, they'll be
infatuated with you! Heheheheh... But I can't sell this
to youngsters like you. ...... I wonder if my woman's
doing okay...
BE BLUE V SALESWOMAN: The year is almost over. A lot is happening outside...
But I'm confident that everything will be better next
year! My store will be open in the new year, so come by
anytime.

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

Fortune-loving Girl: I'm totally hooked on fortune-telling now. I can't bring
every single question to Mama, so I watch TV and read
magazines, but... Everything I wear, and everything I eat,
I decide with my fortune. All I have to do is get as many
fortunes as possible!
Girl's Friend: This is just wrong... But I can't do anything about it. I can't
stop her from doing what she thinks is right.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

MATURE GIRL: My teacher is so boring. I don't really dislike him, he's just
annoying... We're 6-graders... We're almost out of elementary
school! I wish I had another teacher...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: Children all over the world will receive presents from a jolly old man
in a red suit... But, one day they will realize that the jolly old man
doesn't really exist. They will be sad, but their sadness will lead
them to maturity... and then they will leave their childish toys
behind. Christmas... What an interesting holiday...
FUUKA: The second term is always difficult. How do you think you did on the
finals, Main-kun?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: Oh, that's wonderful. I think I did pretty good, too.
But, there were a lot of questions I know I missed, so
I'll have to review them later.
FUUKA: Well, don't get down on yourself... Just review the
questions you missed, and do better next time.
YUKARI: I'm so tired from the exams... This is the same way I felt after the
last midterms... We thought it was going to be the last battle, but it
wasn't...  The more I think about it, the more depressed I get...
KEN: How did you do on your finals, Main-san?
MAIN: 
KEN: Wow, that's great. Given the situation you were in, you
did an amazing job.
KEN: Well, given the situation you were in, I'd say you did a
pretty good job.
KEN: Well, don't feel bad about it. You couldn't have been
expected to do well, given the situation you were in.
JUNPEI: Dude, I think I bombed the exams. But, how can I be expected to
concentrate when I know the world is going to end...?
AKIHIKO: Well, at least we have Christmas to look forward to... Let's try and
have some fun... because this may be our last one.
WEATHER MAN: It's nothin' but sun on today's weather map, for the rest
of the week! For everyone who was looking forward to a
WHITE CHRISTMAS: too bad! Now, let's join the rest of the
gang back in the studio!
NEWSCASTER: Welcome to Hyper-Action News, bringing you all the day's
news, and more news besides!

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

KEN: So much is going on, I almost forgot about Christmas... It's like I was
sleepwalking... And I opened my eyes and was like, "Oh yeah, Christmas..."
FUUKA: Here's the Christmas Tree... Main-san, what
do you think the true meaning of Christmas is?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: Yes, I agree. The Christmas spirit should put a smile
on everyone's face. So, let's be happy!
FUUKA: That's what I think too. The Christmas spirit should put
a smile on everyone's face. So, let's be happy!
FUUKA: Um, well... I guess from a business perspective, that's
true... The Christmas spirit should put a smile on
everyone's face. So, let's be happy!

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR, DAYTIME ===

AKIHIKO: It's been a while since Ryoji disappeared... I wonder what he's doing.
Maybe he's cursing fate... Why does he even care about life on earth?
JUNPEI: I don't really wanna think about it... No matter what we do,
we can't stop it from happening... It's just not fair...
KOROMARU: 
AKIHIKO: I wish I could just forget about it, too. But, the day will
come... We have to decide our answer by then.
JUNPEI: Dammit, why don't those Strega dumbasses make a move? They better hurry
up so I can crush 'em.
AKIHIKO: I agree. I won't forgive them for what happened to Shinji and
Chidori.
KOROMARU: Awoooo!
JUNPEI: Heh, he agrees with us too.
KOROMARU: Woof!

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

Short-haired Housewife: My eldest is having his exams soon. The atmosphere at
home is very tense now... Even I get tense, remembering
the time when I took my own exams...
HOUSEWIFE WITH BRAIDS: I took my kid to the Iwatodai strip mall, and we
had lunch together at Wakatsu. My husband saw an
ad for them that talked about young prodigies,
or something... I don't know if my kid got
smarter from eating the meal, but on the other
hand, he did pass the exam.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

TAXI DRIVER: There was some drive to clean the stations up, but I don't think
it's working here. There's trash all over, bicycles scattered on
the floor... But I'm not complaining. I like it this way!

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

MITSURU: I have no choice but to go on... The answer was in front of me the
entire time... If I do not come back, then someone else will have to
run the company. Although, I have every intention of returning.
YUKARI: It's not like me just to give up. I've made up my mind... I'm going to
fight to the end.
NARRATOR: On the next episode of Phoenix Ranger Featherman R!

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: Every year when Christmas gets close, you see more couples,
huh...? Well, I was the same way last Christmas, so I'm not
really one to talk.
FEMALE STUDENT: Yeah, it's no fun to spend Christmas alone. The magazines have
so many articles about stuff like, "The most romantic spot."
People like me who don't have boyfriends are going to drive
themselves crazy trying to get one.
COMPLAINING GIRL: I love Christmas! The whole town lights up... I get all
excited!

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: This is bullshit, man. Who cares about test results when the world is
coming to an end...? Either way, it's depressing news.
FEMALE STUDENT: I actually did pretty well. Now, I don't have to be depressed
during the holiday break. How about y-- Hm... You look kinda
pale... W-Well, it's not the end of the world. Plus, you have
another chance... So, cheer up...
MALE STUDENT: Did you see the scores? Man, I blew it... I wasn't the last on
the list, but... it's definitely gonna affect my future. Ugh...
Everything is getting dark...

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

MAN: Everybody's in the Christmas spirit, but I'm not feeling it. But what can
you do? I'm just gonna keep dancing.
WOMAN: I'm not one of those people who likes spending Christmas by myself...
But it's worse to rush and try to hook up, just for the holidays. I'd
rather dance than waste my time like that.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

CAT: Meow...
Cat-obsessed Boy: I studied all about cats. I learned cats can't see the color
red. I wonder what that's like...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

FUUKA: My exam grades were what I expected, so I feel relieved. Now, what
should I do for Christmas...?
JUNPEI: Christmas is almost here! Ya excited for it?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Cool! Let's enjoy Christmas!
JUNPEI: Whaddya talking about!? This might be our last
Christmas! You gotta enjoy it while it lasts, dude!
AKIHIKO: I don't care how I did on the exams. I have such a hard decision to
make... My teachers used to tell me not to worry about test scores...
This is what they must have meant.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

Movei-loving Man: It's that time of the year when there's nothing but reruns
on TV. But reruns aren't so bad, man. They make you nostalgic
for your younger days, you know?

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

KEN: Most teenage boys your age tend to spend Christmas with their girlfriends.
What about you, Main-san? Do you have anyone special to spend Christmas
with?
MAIN: 
KEN: Wow... You sound like an adult...
KEN: Well, I'm sure you'll find that special someone soon.
AKIHIKO: We have a day off tomorrow because it's the Emperor's birthday. I
don't have any plans. Do you?
MAIN: 
AKIHIKO: Oh, let me guess... You're going to get ready for
Christmas, right? Well, good luck on choosing a
present your girlfriend will like.
AKIHIKO: So, you're going to make this Christmas a meaningful
one, eh? That's good thinking. It may be our last one.
NEWSCASTER: --concludes today's news of the Apathy Syndrome epidemic. In
lighter news, we join our foreign correspondent live from
Rockefeller Center in New York City! She'll give us a look

MITSURU: Don't think of this as our last Christmas. Simply think of it as this
year's Christmas... and enjoy it.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

SALARYMAN: Those were the good'ol days... I'd come here with my wife and little
girl, do some shopping, and eat before going home... Never again...

SNOOPY REPORTER: Just like the mystery doesn't take holidays, we reporters
can't take holidays either. But I think I'm close to a real
breakthrough on this one... I can't take a break when I'm this
close.

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

YUKARI: The other day, I was flipping through a magazine when I saw this
poll... It was about how much money women wanted their boyfriends to
spend on their Christmas presents. I usually get so excited thinking
about my Christmas presents... But this Christmas, I just want one
thing, and it doesn't cost anything.
KEN: My mother and Shinjiro-san are both looking over me... so I can't give up.
I'll do whatever it takes.
AKIHIKO: The battle begins when you stare into the eyes of your opponent. The
first one who looks away loses. I'm going to stare right into Nyx's
eyes... and I won't look away.
NEWSCASTER: --Christmas Eve tomorrow. Many Christmas trees all over
town will shine through the night...

=== CLUBS HALL ===

FEMALE STUDENT: Don't you worry sometimes about the stains the art students
leave?
MAIN: 
FEMALE STUDENT: I know they work with paint, but they should
still clean up after themselves. Every year,
there's a huge clean-up effort... They could
save time if they would do it every day.
FEMALE STUDENT: Really...?

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

FUUKA: I wonder what Ryoji-kun will do this Christmas... Is he going to spend
it with a girl, having fun? Or, is he going to spend it alone, crying?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: I hope so... That would be the best way for him to spend
it.
FUUKA: ...... We're thinking of killing a person who may be all
alone on Christmas...
KEN: I wonder why everyone wants to spend time with their loved ones so much...
Christmas is still fun, even if you're alone...
JUNPEI: Hey, man, looks like it's gonna be a lonely Christmas for both of us!
So we should go nuts tonight! You wanna hit the town, just the two of
us?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Dude, take it easy. I was just kidding, so don't get
your panties in a bunch.
JUNPEI: Ha! Dude, I was just kidding!
AKIHIKO: It's going to be winter vacation soon... I wonder what we'll finally
decide... Whatever it is, I hope we won't regret it.
FITNESS EXPERT: Christmas is tomorrow! Don't stop exercising with all
those feasts! Today's Cantonese word is "Haime"! Flex
your face and say, "Haime!" "Haime" means "Are you
serious!?" It's like, "Haime," I have to work on
Christmas!? That's all for this week! Back to the news!

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: There's only one week left.. This will be both the longest and
shortest week of our lives.
YUKARI: Christmas has come... All that's left now is New Year's Eve... Have you
made your decision?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Oh, that's good.
YUKARI: Well, we still have a few days to think about it. Take
your time and make a decision you can live with.
KEN: Everyone at school is so happy because vacation is about to start. But,
none of them realize what's going to happen... They have no idea about the
decision we have to make...
JUNPEI: The last exams were frickin' hard, weren't they? I bombed all of them.
But, compared to all that's going on... my bad grades don't seem to
matter that much, heh...
NEWSCASTER: --about half the students were absent from the closing
ceremony after the 2nd term, due to Apathy Syndrome...

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

MITSURU ADMIRER: My plan called "Give Mitsuru-senpai A Present" didn't
work. Which makes sense, if you think about it. I mean,
Mitsuru-senpai lives in a dorm, right? The security
there must be pretty tight... I went up to the front
door, but I couldn't get in.
COMPLAINING GIRL: Now that Christmas is over, all the stores are closing, and
all the lights have been taken down. Usually, there's a post-
Christmas sales war... But it feels weird.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: I SHOULD get to enjoy winter break, after a semester like that... But
instead, we've got a frickin' impossible decision to make. This sucks.
MALE STUDENT: All those people who hooked up during Christmas are just fooling
themselves. Their relationships won't last, man. They treat each
other just like an accessory. Man, I'm glad I didn't hook up with
anyone around then.

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

MAN: Christmas? Yeah, it was great! I bought a leftover cake on the 25th, and
I just stuffed myself at home in the dark. I didn't even use any utensils!
Som Christmas, huh? Hahahaha...!
WOMAN: Isn't this town weird? It's all dirty, and messy. I'm really sensitive
to it... I can't concentrate anymore. It's messing up my rhythm.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: When I think about my grandfather... and what he did... I get so
angry... If it wasn't for him, everything would be okay right now. I
know it's not good to dwell on the past, but...
NEWSCASTER: --brand goods were stolen. The crowd was so large that
there are no suspects or witnesses yet... However, the
majority of the consumers were women buying Christmas
gifts, so...

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

YUKARI: Christmas is over... All that's left now is New Year's Eve... Have you
made your decision?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Oh, that's good.
YUKARI: Well, we still have a few days to think about it. Take
your time and make a decision you can live with.

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

JUNPEI: Chidori gave me her life... and I won't forget that. I'd rather die
than forget.
FUUKA: I read in a book that fear is an emotion we learned to keep us away from
danger. But I don't think that you can truly live, if you're always
running away from danger because you're afraid. By facing our fears,
we feel alive... So, I...

YUKARI: Doesn't it seem like the expression on everyone's faces has changed?
It's like they've all come to a realization or something.
MAIN: 
YUKARI: I wonder if everyone's made up their minds...
YUKARI: You're kinda slow, huh? You have no clue what's going
on with the others, do you? So, have you made your
decision yet?

FOOD GIRL: Now my dad says all that weird stuff, too... He's right there with
my mom, saying the end is coming...  I don't wanna go home.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

NERVOUS MAN: I feel really awkward these days... ... I'm getting
worried... Is she okay...? She looks like this kind of thing
happens to her every day...
PATIENT WOMAN: It sounds preachy to talk about moral stuff like this, but this
is when people's bonds are tested. At times like this, when the
whole town is going crazy, and there's nowhere to run... I'm
thankful he's here with me. What about you? Do you have anyone
that will stay with you?

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

NEWSCASTER: A survey of the year's most popular news topics put Apathy
Syndrome as the #1 subject...

MITSURU: Have you heard? Aigis will be back tonight.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

LAZY STUDENT: The people who believe in the End have at least some energy
left... I mean, they have enough in them to believe in something,
y'know? I don't even have that much, man. It's over for me.

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

MITSURU: The people at the laboratory told me she has feelings now. They said
she's more "human."
AKIHIKO: We're ready... All we need is for Ryoji to show up.
JUNPEI: Hey, did something happen to Ai-chan when she was getting repaired? She
looks so... different... like she's human.
FUUKA: They said Aigis has been repaired... but I don't agree with that. She
seems totally different now...
AIGIS: Now I know why I'm here. My destination lies in the decision we make.
Let's choose wisely.
KEN: What a mysterious thing... She changed from a robot to a human being. She
used to be so formal... But now, she's like a big sister...
YUKARI: Wow, Aigis has changed so much... She's so... "human" now. Do you think
I'll still be able to talk to her like I did before?
FEMALE REPORTER: Hi, I'm Trish, wih today's installment of "Who's

KEN: I am sure of my answer.
YUKARI: I've been thinking about this for a long time...
MITSURU: The day is finally here... I know my answer.
JUNPEI: Ryoji's not here yet? Dude, where the hell is he?
FUUKA: I know what my answer is. I will keep moving forward.
NEWSCASTER: The Apathy Syndrome keeps spreading, causing unrest in

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

PHARMACY SHOPKEEPER: This area's getting more dangerous. I had a thief break
into my storage basement. I wonder how he got in there...
Well, however he did it, I bet he had the scare of a
lifetime once he saw what was inside... Heheheh.
ANTIQUES OWNER: ...How long has it been since you began visiting my store...?
I can't believe that I'm involved with another Persona-user ten
years after I stopped working with Kirijo-san... But, I'm glad
that Persona-user is you... Even though I'm always worried
about your well being...
FORTUNE TELLER: Would you like to know your fortune?
MAIN: 
FORTUNE TELLER: Very well... You have pulled the trigger of
fate... I see it now... The target was the
shadow of impending doom... Your goal is now
clear... Keep your flame of life ablaze until
the end... Farewell, then... May your future be
bright...
FORTUNE TELLER: Come back any time...

=== NAGANAKI SHRINE ===

AKIHIKO: I'm not used to seeing the girls like that... I'm kind of embarrassed
to look at them.
YUKARI: How could Stupei say such a thing to a kid!? But you know, it's nice to
do this sort of thing once in a while. Let's think positive thoughts,
and hope for the best results.
AIGIS: I drew a paper fortune, and it read "Great Luck". I'm anticipating
excellent results.
FUUKA: Wearing this makes me feel renewed. Althought the sash makes it... hard
to breathe...
JUNPEI: Dude! I didn't say that! D-Dont make things up!
KEN: What...? But you...
KOROMARU: Arf! Arf!
MAN: I pulled the fortune out, and it was "Worst Luck"... That's a hell of a
way to start the New Year.
WOMAN: Don't you hate getting the "Worst Luck" fortune? I feel like he's the
reason my luck is so bad... Maybe I should break up with him.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: I'm happy that we were able to celebrate the new year, but... This
month is going to be very important. Make sure you spend your time
wisely.
FUUKA: The new year always brings new beginnings. So, let's refresh our minds
and do our best to defeat Nyx.
AIGIS: I never understood the significance of a new year... It never really
meant that much to me. But with all that has happened, now I realize
that it's a time to leave behind the past... and look forward to the
future. Everything is possible in the new year.
YUKARI: Junpei is so...  On the first day of the new year, after making
our big decision, he... Tch! He's such a pervert!
KEN: I couldn't ask before, but... is it true that all the girls in kimono
go "commando"?
MAIN: 
KEN: Not wearing underwear in the winter isn't very prudent.
KEN: Oh, so it was a lie... I knew the girls wouldn't go
outside without wearing underwear. Junpei-san is beginning
the new year acting childish...
KEN: A mystery...? Come on, does it really matter if the girls
do or don't wear underwear?
JUNPEI: Hey, lemme ask you somethin'... When you think of a kimono, you think
of a chick with a great figure going "commando", right?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: C'mon, dude. Don't play dumb. You know it's every guy's
fantasy!
JUNPEI: Ha! I knew you'd agree!
JUNPEI: C'mon, dude. Don't play dumb... You know it's every
guy's fantasy!
AKIHIKO: After all that's happened... it's good to be starting a new year.
NEWSCASTER: --Happy New Year! And now, the first news of 2010. The
year's first Apathy Sydrome patient was admitted at 1:13
AM...

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

MITSURU: The mantra of the cult is, "If you believe, you will be saved."
Ridiculous, isn't it? We will need to keep our guards up. The public
seems to be fooled by these words.
YUKARI: Have you seen the headlines? You know, the ones saying "Mysterious
Cult in Town" and "The End is Near"? It must be because of Nyx.
FUUKA: I heard that cult held a meeting recently. I wonder how much that will
affect this city... I'm really worred...
AKIHIKO: If you believe, you will be saved... Tch, what a joke. Who would buy
that?
AIGIS: That mysterious cult put posters up all over town... But, they haven't
done anything since then. Not that that's a bad thing... It's just a
little unnerving.
KEN: I saw a news report about that cult. They've become so big so quickly.
Weird, huh?

=== PAULOWNIA MALL, DAYTIME ===

OLD MAN: Even if email is in vogue today, I'm still happy to get New Year's
cards. You got any friends you send New Year's cards to?
MAIN: 
OLD MAN: You ever heard the rhyme? "Make new friends, but keep
the old; One is silver, and the other's gold."
OLD MAN: At your age? Now that's depressing. Your New Year's
resolution oughta be to meet new people, then.
GAMER STUDENT: I finally got the hang of it! I'm getting prizes every time!
MY ULTIMATE GOAL: to complete the collection!
BE BLUE V SALESWOMAN: Happy New Year! Remember to visit our store locations in
the new year!

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

WOMAN: These posters and paints are far from meaningless for us. By our acts,
we will change the flow of causality... The concept of Salvation will be
in greater harmony with the earth, tipping the scales to Deliverance.
The earth, seeking salvation, will become an empty vessel for Nyx-sama
to fill.
MAN: Sheesh, that lady's nuts. I don't get what she's saying at all. Maybe
she's got brain damage? Though I'm a believer too, so I'm not really one
to talk.
FEMALE STUDENT: I asked her what all those papers and paintings mean... And she
started spouting all that nonsense... It sounds like a lecture
or something. I believe in the Deliverance, and the End, and
all that, but I still can't follow what she's saying...

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

TAXI DRIVER: Did you see those flyers? I heard a lot of people are buying into
that stuff. Never underestimate the power of a piece of paper. I
lost my family to a slip of paper... My wife left me... This damn
cabbie job wasn't paying enough for me to take care of the
family...
MALE STUDENT: I don't like having a rank and following orders, so I didn't
think I'd like the cult, either. But there's this guy who really
speaks to the people... Everyone respects whatever he says. Apart
from him, we're all equals. So this cult isn't as strict as I
thought it would be. I don't mind it so much.
MAN: Don't those who preach to others care about what people think of them?
I wouldn't be able to do it... I'm not that kind of person.
MAN: In this world, there is much filth. This is one reason we require
Deliverance. At this rate, even when the Deliverance is at hand, the world
will not be totally clean. We must continue to prepare for that day.
Heaven has charged us with preparing for the Deliverance. Our task is
great, and of vital importance. Do not disturb our work.

=== NAGANAKI SHRINE ===

WOMAN: Getting out of the rut my life's stuck in sounds good... But that stuff
about "Deliverance" and "the End" rubs me the wrong way.
LADY: You hear many bad things these days, but never fear. This world's
salvation is at hand. Don't get me wrong, I'm not telling you what to
believe or anything. After all, I didn't believe it in the beginning,
either.

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

JUNPEI: Have you seen what that cult did? What a mess!
NEWSCASTER: --concentrating on the paint and posters all over town.
Since all the materials share similar designs, police
believe they're the work of one culprit...

=== PAULOWNIA MALL, EVENING ===

MALE STUDENT: Those posters and paints... I used to be a little into that. But
between you and me, I only did it because everyone else was. At
the time, I was so pumped... I thought I was doing something
great. Now I can look back on it and realize how dumb I was.
WOMAN: They say the end will come soon, but I can't imagine it... If it was
going to be like a big earthquake, or a tsunami, I'd be scared, but...
Oh, well. If you believe, you will be saved, right?
MALE STUDENT: Deliverance is coming soon. Did you know that? The Absolute Will
is coming from the sky to save us. You, too, should join us.
Cleanse your impure mind and wait for the time to come.

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

WOMAN: Guys who know they're charming have no problem in life. Especially at
times like this... A little charm goes a long way. I'm sure you know
what I mean. I'd much rather listen to you than those cultist freaks...
MAN: Dude, this town is filthy! No joke! Especially those posters! I keep
seeing those damn cultists putting them up! Why don't you go dance, man?
You'll feel a little better.
Fortune-loving Girl: The town is becoming strange... But if you stay here,
you'll be fine. Just listen to what Mama says, and nothing
bad can happen.
Girl's Friend: They say if you truly believe, nothing can go wrong, but...
Isn't that the way those cultists think, too? I think it's
better to decide things for yourself, and not rely on fortune-
tellers.

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

AIGIS: I will stand beside you until the very end. Even though I only have this
one month to spend with you... I will have no regrets.
YUKARI: Don't talk like that, Aigis...
MITSURU: Yukari... The chances that we will beat Nyx are slim.
AIGIS: That may be true... But, there is a possibility. We must spend
this month increasing our chances.
MITSURU: It's been three days now... The weight has been lifted from our
shoulders, but...
YUKARI: To be honest, I do feel a little regret...
AIGIS: That can't be helped. It's human nature to wonder about the
choice that was not chosen.
MITSURU: That's true. People are always asking themselves, "What
if...?"
YUKARI: But, I don't want to have any regrets... because this is what
I chose.
YUKARI: Things are getting out of hand... Before, The Lost were here and there,
but now it's just crazy.
AIGIS: Many people have been affected by Nyx. I fear it may get even
worse on the day of Nyx's revival.
MITSURU: It's astonishing that Nyx can affect an entire city... We're
the only ones who can do something about it. We have to fight
no matter what.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

FEMALE STUDENT: That guy right there is popular, just because he's so into it.
But... He's so into it, that we can't understand what he
means...

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

NEWSCASTER: --took into control a man who went out of control at the
shrine. The unidentified man would only repeat, "The Fall
is deliverance..."

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

BE BLUE V SALESWOMAN: There are so many of those flyers all over now... I
wonder what's going on.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

STATION ATTENDANT: People's manners are geting even worse these days. They
litter, argue, fight, and people are starting to get hurt.
And I'm the one who has to field all the complaints as a
result. It's getting on my nerves...

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

NEWSCASTER: A man has been arrested for his attempts to recruit others
into his suicide ring. The detainee was an unemployed
30-year-old man intensely devoted to cult-related
magazines...

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

AKIHIKO: As you know, whatever occurs during the Dark Hour is acknowledged
differently by the public. That includes atacks by Shadows. So if a
person is found injured, the attack is usually blamed on a robber.
And if someone disappears, it's considered a kidnapping or an
abduction. These incidents are sporadic... and are classified as
mysterious causes because everything about them is unexplainable. But
now, the numbers of incidents are increasing so fast that they're
drawing the public's attention.
KEN: If you believe, you will be saved... I wonder if anyone actually thinks
that's true... It kind of reminds me of those advertisements in the back
of a magazine... You know, the ones that say, "Buy this product and you'll
be happier!"
AIGIS: Koromaru-san has very good eyes. We'll need those eyes to see through
the lies of that cult.
JUNPEI: School's starting again. I wonder how everyone's doing...
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: That's true. The vacation wasn't long enough for
anyone to change.
JUNPEI: Y-You're joking, right? I mean, you can't be serious...
cuz if that's how it's gonna be, I'm not going, dude!
MITSURU: Cases of Apathy Syndrome are on the rise again. There have been a lot
of people reported missing as well. This is not good. Society is
crumbling before our eyes.
YUKARI: Everyone's so interested in the cult. There are news reports on it
every single day. It makes me sick... I hope our school won't be like
that.
MAIN: 
YUKARI: How depressing... I don't even want to think about it.
YUKARI: I hope so...
FUUKA: The cult members talk about salvation and deliverance... But, people
have different ways they want to be saved... Some people want money,
others want peace... I wonder what the cult members want...

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

CAT: ......
Cat-obsessed Boy: I studied all about cats, and I told my dad about it. He said
I did a great job, and he was impressed! And he promised he
was gonna convince my mom! I hope I can get this cat...

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

NARRATOR: --In the end, this old Apathy Syndrome patient died, due to
malnutrition. This man was the first patient that the young
doctor was not able to save. Tears rolled down his eyes...
NEWSCASTER: That was our special report. Coming up next, the news.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

Movie-loving Man: What would you do if the world was going to end? I would just
have fun, man. I mean, we're talking about lowering the
curtain on all life. I imagine it saying "THE END," in big
letters, and then outtakes from my life. If you think about
it that way, it sounds a lot more fun, right?

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===


=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

SNOOPY REPORTER: There was a magazine profile on the founder of that cult. But
I don't think it's worth all the attention... It's just a
little club that those kids made up. Right?

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

FITNESS EXPERT: Happy New Year! Now for the first exercise of 2010! I
won't tell you how old I am, but it's pretty old!
Today's Cantonese word is "Hoisamuro"! Punch the air
and say, "Hoisamuro!" "Hoisamuro" means "Yay!" All
those students finished with exams are saying,
"Hoisamuro!" That's all for this week! Back to more
cult-related news!

=== FRONT GATE ===

GIRLFRIEND: I'm waiting for my boyfriend... I've been feeling really anxious
lately, so... he's going to walk me home today.

=== CLUBS HALL ===

FEMALE STUDENT: It's filthy in front of the art class... Can't they clean up
after themselves?

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: All I read about in the magazines now is that cult stuff. I
guess the members of those things take them seriously... It's
just disturbing, seeing them popping up everywhere.
FEMALE STUDENT: TV, Internet, everywhere... All I hear about is the cult, the
cult, the cult. So, uh... What cult is it?
MITSURU ADMIRER: Mitsuru-senpai was in a kimono over New Year's!? Did you get
any pictures!?
MAIN: 
MITSURU ADMIRER: Well, where are they, then!? Don't joke about
something like this! I'll knock you silly!
MITSURU ADMIRER: Oh... Some help you are.
COMPLAINING GIRL: My parents apologized to me all of a sudden... They said they
were being too controlling. It's pretty awkward when your own
parents apologize like that...

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: It's been a while since we were here. Everything looks so different...
I don't like this depressing atmosphere.
JUNPEI: Dude, can you believe how many people are into this cult thing? It's
messed up, if you ask me.
FAT STUDENT: New Year's Day sucks, man. Everyone expects you to make a
resolution... even though there's no way you'll keep it.
MALE STUDENT: If you ask me, kimonos aren't as cool as people think. It's nice
when a hot chick wears one, but if she's a fatty, then it's just
gross. That's what they call a double-edged sword.

=== ROOFTOP ===

STALKER GIRL: Uh-oh... That guy's staring at me... I hope he's not going to
ask me out...
STALKED BOY: Argh! I can't take this anymore! I'm going to ask her out! Don't
worry, I know she'll say yes! I mean, she was the one following me
around in the first place! I'm going to make her mine!

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

Short-haired Housewife: Did you see the news? Some thug broke into the hall
where the university testing is held... My eldest is
entering high school next month... I-I'm worried.
HOUSEWIFE WITH BRAIDS: One of my neighbors' sons went to that assembly
hall... He said people there were screaming
"Nyx" or something, with angry looks on their
faces.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

SALARYMAN: I don't know when it happened, but this town is a mess lately. Since
my life is a mess, too, it feels like I'm not alone anymore. Hm? My
family? Ugh, I feel like the worst person alive... I'm lying to my
wife and my daughter... I loved my family, but now it's like they're
just baggage...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

MITSURU: I knew the cult would have some influence over the school, but I never
imagined it would be to this extent. Can you think of any effective
ways to counter them?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: You're right... All we can do is hope that people are
strong enough to resist the ult.
MITSURU: ...I would prefer not to do that. Eliminating the cult
should only be our last resort.
MITSURU: You're right... We have to defeat Nyx to break the
control the cult has over everyone.
AIGIS: I didn't expect that cult to become so popular. I thought more people
would oppose it. But, it's like a fire drawing moths to its flame.
AKIHIKO: Everyone at school thinks this is just a normal thir term. They have
no clue that this may be the last third term ever. Isn't it weird that
we're the only ones who know about this?
YUKARI: I used to think that our school would be safe from that cult... but I
was wrong. All our classmates are talking about the end of the world
now.  They have no idea what's really going on.
FUUKA: As we expected, the cult has made its way to our school... Some people
are fully devoted to it. We have to do something about Nyx...
KEN: My teacher was talking about the cult during class the other day. She
wasn't trying to convince us to join it, though. But I heard that a lot
of teachers at the high school are trying to convince their students to
join it.
NEWSCASTER: --research shows that children's New Year's gifts are being
affected by Apathy Syndrome. Due to the epidemic, the
parents are unable to visit their relatives, and...

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR ===

JUNPEI: Damn Strega... We don't have time to play hide and seek. We better find
them, before they make more trouble for us. Why don't we let Koromaru
sniff them out?
KOROMARU: Woof...?
KOROMARU: Woof!

=== CLUBS HALL ===

Cell-phone student: Before, I'd take a picture whenever I saw one of those
Apathy Syndrome people. I sent them to everyone on my
contacts list, saying "I found an Apathy Syndrome guy!" But
now, they're common as oxygen. It's a pretty scary thing to
get used to. Is it going to go away someday, or are we
stuck with it forever?

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

JUNPEI: Hey, the national test is on the 16th and 17th of this month. Akihiko-
san and Mitsuru-san are both gonna ace it. They try to hide it, but
they study all the time.
NEWSCASTER: Up next, stock market news. Going into the month, safety-
related companies are seeing large gains. The apocolyptic
thinking that's spreading among the populace is said to be
a major factor...

=== PAULOWNIA MALL, EVENING ===

FEMALE STUDENT: I see... The Deliverance... Honestly, I don't think it'll
happen... But if it does, that would solve a lot of problems.

=== DORM LOUNGE, DAYTIME ===

MITSURU: The national admissions test? Yes, Akihiko and I will be taking it. I
believe it's on the 16th and 17th. It's only held during the day...
so we'll be back in plenty of time to go to Tartarus.
JUNPEI: You know we're off tomorrow cuz it's a holiday, right? Yeah, it's
Coming of Age Day. Like I said, I'm just hoping I can make it to my
20th birthday.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

OLD MAN: It seems to be the thing to do to join that cult thing now... But why
isn't anyone trying to stop them from doing such a damn fool thing?

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

NARRATOR: On the next episode of Phoenix Ranger Featherman R!
Episode 46: The Great Devil's Tomato Farm! Owl doesn't like
tomatos!?
NEWSCASTER: ...And now, the news. City officials are concerned that the
graffiti and posters are destroying the town's image,
and...

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR, DAYTIME ===

YUKARI: The cult's influence has spread across the city, and even into our
school. Everyone is talking about how the world is going to end, as if
it's a fact.
JUNPEI: Man, why are people so weak?
FUUKA: Not everyone can be like us...
AIGIS: Unlike robots, human are all unique. Some people never give up,
while others submit immediately.
FUUKA: Believing or not believeing in the cult is a personal decision...
Myself, I would never believe in it. When I think of my friendship with
Natsuki-chan, I have no need to join the cult.
AIGIS: The bond of friendship... It sounds like a fairy talke, but I
believe it is what all humans seek.
YUKARI: I agree, the most important thing is the connection two people
share.
JUNPEI: That's right... No one can survive alone.
AIGIS: About the cult... I wonder how many people truly believe in it. It seems
much of the public is openly saying that the end of the world is coming.
YUKARI: Yeah, even people I know. Most of them got interested through
friends.
JUNPEI: I heard some people talking the other day, too. They were
saying that every day is so boring, the end of the world
wouldn't be so bad...
FUUKA: In other words, this cult is kind of like shopping... It helps
people fill the emptiness they feel inside.
JUNPEI: Who's the dumbass in charge of that cult? Here we are bustin' our
asses, and they go and pull this crap.
AIGIS: You can't just blame the cult. The cult exists only because
there are people willing to believe in it.
JUNPEI: I guess that's true... Well, we have to do something...

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

MATURE GIRL: The other day, my teacher called on me in class. I just ignored
him, cause I don't like him much... I thought he would get mad at
me, like he did at that practice, but he just made a sad face...
I-It's not my fault! It's his fault for being so boring!

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

NEWSCASTER: Today is Coming of Age day, and there were parties planned
in each area for those turning 20. However, due to Apathy
Syndrome, many of the parties had to be cancelled.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

FUUKA: I've seen the screen name Jin before. He's very popular, and has a lot
of support from his followers. He's a very charismatic figure. I can't
believe he's the same Jin as the one from Strega...
KEN: I think the magazines that interviewed Strega are ridiculous. They're
acting careless... Do they think that they can just write whatever they
want as long as it helps sell magazines?
MAIN: 
KEN: Yeah, it's definitely a breach of business ethics.
KEN: That's true... but it still doesn't make it right.
KEN: It's a difficult problem, indeed. I wonder if I'll still
worry about such things when I'm an adult...
AIGIS: I have to admit, Strega knows how to control the media well. But, I'm a
little disappointed in the media for being so easily controlled by them.
Do you think the media were paid off by Strega to promote them?
...Actually, that would be even more disappointing...
MITSURU: 95% of the people who are referred to as charismatic by the media are
fakes. Then, would Strega be considered to be in the remaining 5%?
The answer is no. They don't have charisma. They're just agitators who
are stirring up unreast in society.
JUNPEI: Friggin' Strega... Blaming us for everything that's goin' on... That
really pisses me off!
YUKARI: I think Stega is controlling people by taking advantage of their
insecurities. So, if people have enough confidence, Strega probably
can't influence them. So then, we should just ignore their preaching,
right?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: So, no matter what, just don't forget who you are.
That's the key.
YUKARI: That may not be the best attitude to take in this
situation.
YUKARI: Wow, you're really happy-go-lucky. Even in a situation
like this, you can still crack a joke.
AKIHIKO: Even if I wasn't in SEES, I still wouldn't join the cult. Would you?
MAIN: 
AKIHIKO: I assert my individuality through boxing, so there's
no room for the cult to come into my life. You seem to
have an activity that you assert your individuality
through, too.
AKIHIKO: Then, you need to assert your individuality through an
activity so the cult doesn't have a chance to get you.
For example, I assert myself through boxing.
WEATHER MAN: As you can see from the map, it'll be sunny skies all week
long! Those of you with entrance exams won't have to worry
about getting snowed in! Now, back to the studio!
NEWSCASTER: Now back to Hyper-Action News, where we give you all the
day's news and more besides!

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: Don't you think it's hard not to stare at people talking about cult
stuff?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: I try not to, but I can't help it. Sometimes I stare
too long and they start getting suspicious.
JUNPEI: I know, I know... It's better to just ignore them.

=== ROOFTOP ===

FAT STUDENT: Mmm... I'm so bored... I don't feel like doing anything.
MAIN: 
FAT STUDENT: You know what I mean, right? It's like everything
is this huge waste of time now... I think the
world should just end.
FAT STUDENT: Man, you're tough... How do you do it...?

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

WOMAN: Soon, Mother Nyx will descend from the heavens, bringing the great
Deliverance. It will be the greates single act of salvation that mankind
has ever witnessed. We humans, trapped in our earthly forms, will be
embraced in Nyx's arms... We will sleep soundlessly and dream forever,
a dream of all beings melted into one form... This form will shatter to
pieces in Nyx's crucible, bringing about our salvation.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

MAN: Listen to the emptiness, and empty your own heart... You will hear a
sound. That is the sound of Nyx-sama. Her heartbeat... Her breath... Her
whisper... When the Deliverance is at hand, your heart will be free of
pain, and you will be at peace. You fools, however, will not receive the
Deliverance. You lack trust in Nyx-sama. The pain in your heart will be as
the burning red flames of Hell!

=== NAGANAKI SHRINE ===

LADY: I heard Nyx-sama will save our world. My life's been going downhill, and
I'm getting tired of it... At my lowest point, I found out about
Nyx-sama, and my heart came to life again. How about it? Will you let
Nyx-sama into your heart too? Oh, don't worry, I'm not going to force you
or anything. After all, I didn't believe it in the beginning, either.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

NEWSCASTER: A magazine released yesterday is making waves throughout
the community. The uproar stems from an article about a
cult leader known as Charisma. According to the teachings
of Nyxism, there is a power that eliminates worries of the
future. Belief in this ability is causing many young
students to sign up for the cult...

=== PAULOWNIA MALL, EVENING ===

MALE STUDENT: He's a great man... He understands my pain, and has answers to
all my questions. Thanks to him, I have accepted the teachings
of Nyx. If only I had the words to explain to you how wonderful
it feels...

=== CLUBS HALL ===

FEMALE STUDENT: Please don't dump the chemicals into the sink. Put them in the
chemical waste bin instead. If you have no other choice but to
empty it into the sink, let the water run after it for a long
time. Trust me...

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: Not everyone is involved in the cult. I wonder why some people join and
others don't?

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

GAMER STUDENT: When I get a little better, I'm gonna come here with my friend.
He said he wanted to see my skills.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

NERVOUS MAN: I'm really worried... We're spending so much time together, it
seems like it has to end... It's just me, right...?
PATIENT WOMAN: Yeah, it's just you. This will never end...

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

FOOD GIRL: My mom and dad keep saying this weird phrase... "Believe in Ny-sama
and be saved!" But... Who's Nyx-sama?

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

NEWSCASTER: --today's exchange rate. The yen is now 108.42 to the
dollar. Japan's currency has experienced a tremendous
decline... The result of the Apathy Syndrome and cult
teachings is becoming...

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

TAXI DRIVER: Some cult is gonna save all of humanity? I wonder if they can save
a lowly cabbie like me... I didn't realize how much my family
meant to me until I lost 'em. All I want is to have them back...
You think if I ask Nyx-sama or whatever, I'll get my family
back...?

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

AKIHIKO: Studying for the national admissions test made me think about my
future. So, I'll say this again... We are still moving toward the
future, and we won't let Nyx stand in our way.
KEN: I was thinking about what Strega said, that the Fall is salvation...
Didn't someone else say something similar?
MAIN: 
KEN: Oh, that's right. It was Ikutsuki-san. Do you think it was
just a coincidence?
KEN: Hmm... I don't think it was Ryoji-san.
KEN: He didn't think that way.
KEN: Huh? Who's that? Your teacher...? I see...
AIGIS: The media is trying to swing public opinion by reporting on Strega's
activities in a positive light. And the most popular searches on the
Internet are "Nyx", "cult", and "end of the world". Isn't that
strange...? Why are people looking forward to the Fall?
MAIN: 
AIGIS: Either people have no will to live, or they aren't
allowed to have a will to live... That's the kind of
society we currently live in...
AIGIS: Even if it is interesting, I think people are going too
far... There's a number of people who have already
given up the will to live...
JUNPEI: Those idiots who are being fooled by that cult better wake up, man!
Don't they know that Strega's all behind it...? Can't they see through
all of Strega's negative teachings?
NEWSCASTER: --all you Gemini, the lucky color is orange. To ward off
Apathy Syndrome, wear your shirt inside-out! You never
know... It might work...

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: I remember Strega using the phrase "brothers and sisters" as well as the
word "revolution." Brothers and sisters are the individuals people
depend on most. Revolution is a means by which one can change the world.
I believe it was with words like these that teenagers were targetted.
JUNPEI: We better think this through... Man, now I sound like the teacher.
Who would've thought THAT would happen?

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

FUUKA: I will never devote myself to the cult. Even if I wanted to, Natsuki-
chan's voice would bring me back to reality. As long as I have friends,
there's no need for me to join the cult.
YUKARI: We can make a clear distinction between those who fall for the cult and
those who don't. Do you have any friends besides us who don't believe
in the cult?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: That's reassuring.
YUKARI: Aren't you lonely? Maybe you should try to make some
new friends.
MITSURU: Strega believes the Fall will bring salvation... But I wonder what my
grandfather thought of it... He didn't believe in the future... So
perhaps he also thought like Strega. But, this is just speculation.
The dead cannot speak in their own defense, and the truth is lost in
the darkness...
NEWSCASTER: --college entrance examinations held today. One student who
brought a BB rifle to the testing center sent a panic
through the crowd...

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

FORTUNE TELLER: Would you like to know your fortune?
MAIN: 
FORTUNE TELLER: Very well... I see nothing... No... What I see
is nothingness... It is the void... But do not
lose heart... Emptiness is not necessarily the
end... The void is infinite... As is the
universe... Whether this marks an end to all
things, or a beginning... It is in your
hands... Farewell, then... May your future be
bright...
FORTUNE TELLER: Come back any time...
MAN: Hey, how are you?
MAIN: 
MAN: I see... But that's just temporary, isn't it? It can't
match the Deliverance that Nyx is going to bring.
MAN: Don't worry, your sadness is only temporary. Nyx's
Deliverance will save us all.
WOMAN: I'm not joining any cult. Those people annoy the hell out of me. If I
have to convert to some religion, give me one where I can sing and
dance. It'd probably be healthier, anyway.

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR, DAYTIME ===

JUNPEI: Akihiko-san and Mitsuru-san are taking the college admissions test.
Dude, that'll be us before you know it. I'm not lookin' forward to it,
though.
KEN: Why are there TWO big tests you have to take to get into college? An
entrance exam AND the national test! It sounds tough, but what choice do
we have...?
KOROMARU: Woof! Woof!

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

NARRATOR: On the next episode of Phoenix Ranger Featherman R!
Episode 47: The Great Emperor's Glory! The fight is almost at
its end!
NEWSCASTER: ...And now, the news. Belief in "Nyx" seems to be
increasing throughout the city...

=== DORM 2ND FLOOR, EVENING ===

JUNPEI: To tell ya the truth, the thought of fighting Nyx scares the shit outta
me. But for some reason, when I look at Chidori's drawing, I feel more
courageous. Ever since she sacrificed herself, I've seen life in a
whole new way... I won't let anyone take that away.
KEN: Wow, Junpei-san... I always thought of you as a slacker... But
now, you seem even more determined than Sanada-senpai.
AKIHIKO: Hey, isn't it a little early to be saying that? We'll see how
long it lasts...
AKIHIKO: For me and Shinji, our goal was to get rid of the Dark Hour. But now
he's gone, and the rest is up to me... No matter what, I'm gonna put
an end to this.
KEN: Yes... for Shinjiro-san's sake...
JUNPEI: We can do it, Akihiko-senpai! Let's get Nyx together!
KOROMARU: Woof! Woof!
AKIHIKO: Yeah...
KEN: The Dark Hour has taken so many things away from me. But, you guys have
given me the greatest thing of all--friendship. So, I won't give up...
I'll make sure the Dark Hour disappears.
JUNPEI: You said it, dude! I'm counting on you!
AKIHIKO: I'm sure Shinji is happy too, so hold on to that feeling...

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: I'm certain people still remember the famous prediction about the King
of Terror. I wonder if they feel similarly about the coming of Nyx...
Do they consider it just speculation, like that old prophecy, or do they
see the Fall as inevitable?
MAIN: 
AIGIS: If that's true, then they must not be as worried as we
are.
AIGIS: Then, they must be in utter despair. ...We must do
something.
FAT STUDENT: Choosing a career sucks, man. ...I'm serious this time. Shit, what
should I do...?
MALE STUDENT: I don't know what the hell I was thinking, but I started to hit
on this chick who has Apathy Syndrome. She just ignored me, no
matter what I said. She kept repeating, "Ny-sama," over and over.
This guy Nyx must've rocked her world.

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

Short-haired Housewife: You know how that cult is spreading all over the world
now? D-Does that mean there are cultists in this mall
right now...?
HOUSEWIFE WITH BRAIDS: My neighbor's kid was asked about the Fall, too,
I think... I-I think there really might be some
cultists here... The people around us look
suspicious...

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

SNOOPY REPORTER: I looked into those people who are waiting for the end... I
think they have something to do with the victims of those
mysterious incidents. Which means, the Apathy Syndrome victims
and these people have something in common. Right when that
belief started, this cult appeared... Maybe they know
something about all this. Or maybe they're just using the
situation to gain followers...

KOROMARU: Arf! Arf!
YUKARI: I made Koro-chan a special dinner. I want him to be strong for the
fight. C'mere, Koro-chan...
FUUKA: Good boy, Koro-chan! Eat a lot and get strong!
FUUKA: Do you remember when we had sushi? Well, Koro-chan was the only one who
couldn't have any. So, the special dinner tonight is only for Koro-chan.
I hope you understand, Main-kun.
JUNPEI: That's right, man... Koromaru usually eats regular dog food... but it's
time to give him the good stuff!
AIGIS: Koromaru-san seems very happy. Food is a basic form of energy for dogs,
too. Koromaru-san will be ready for the battle.
AKIHIKO: That dog eats better than we do. What do you have to say about that?
MAIN: 
AKIHIKO: That's true. He has been with us for a while now.
Plus, he needs to be prepared for the big battle.
AKIHIKO: You shouldn't be jealous of a dog. We have the freedom
to eat whatever we want, whenever we want. That's good
enough, right?
KEN: Koromaru's owner was eaten by Shadows, right...? So, even though
Koromaru's a dog... this battle is very important to him.
MITSURU: Koromaru is a vital member of the team. Good thinking, Yukari.
NEWSCASTER: A 50-year-old housewife was implicated in banking fraud...
When questioned, she said a man calling himself "Nyx's Son"
forced her to do it...

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

Fortune-loving Girl: Mama said... I've lost myself. I've become just a puppet
who obeys the orders of fortune-tellers. She said she
can't see my fortune anymore... I always thought that
paying attention to your fortune was the smart way to
live... Have I really become a puppet? What am I supposed
to do...?
Girl's Friend: A puppet who obeys fortune-tellers, huh...? That sounds like a
pretty accurate description to me. I hope she wakes up soon...

=== FRONT GATE ===

GIRLFRIEND: I'm waiting for my boyfriend... I don't know why, but I feel so
anxious when I'm not with him.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: Dude, doesn't that empty seat bother you? Every time I look at it, it
reminds me of him. If Ryoji were to walk in and sit down like nothing
happened, how would you react?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: Me too. Wouldn't that be sweet?
JUNPEI: Yeah, I know. But, I can't stop thinking about it.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

STATION ATTENDANT: People's manners aren't very good anymore. The train and the
plaza are both filthy. Everything around me gets worse and
worse... I don't know if it'll return to normal anymore.
MAIN: 
STATION ATTENDANT: You think so? What makes you say that?
Well, maybe I shouldn't be so downhearted.
STATION ATTENDANT: You either, huh? I tell you, I can't take
this anymore... I should quit my job and
start following that cult.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

NEWSCASTER: During a live demonstration, a man wearing a bandana jumped
up and spoke to the crowd. "Nyx-sama's descent is real!"
said the man. After this...

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

MITSURU ADMIRER: Oh, no... Mitsuru-senpai will graduate pretty soon... It feels
like the world's going to end... I can't imagine going on
without her!
COMPLAINING GIRL: This is so lame... I can't decide on anything. I've never had
so much trouble picking outfits. Oh... I guess my clothes and
my career are totally different things, huh?

=== ROOFTOP ===

STALKER GIRL: You really have to to be careful who you date nowadays... They
say love is blind, but... There's no way I could ever date a guy
like THAT.
STALKED BOY: Well, I asked her out, dude... and she totally rejected me! She
said she didn't like me! Dammit! I can't believe this... SHE was
the one following ME around! Ugh... I feel like I got my heart
torn out of my chest...

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

OLD MAN: You worry because you're confused, and you're confused because you
don't know what to believe in. Humans are frail creatures. It's hard
for us to stand on our own two feet... My advice to you youngsters is
to make friends, and believe in them with all your heart.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

Cat-obsessed Boy: This cat has been acting weird. He keeps staring into space.
I don't understand. But my mom is gonna agree with me and my
dad pretty soon! Today when my dad comes home from work, I'm
going to beg him.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

AKIHIKO: You have your Career Counseling next week, huh? Well, I can only give
you one piece of advice... Start worrying... now.
MITSURU: You'll be having your Future Consultation soon. Have you given it any
consideration?
MAIN: 
MITSURU: Good. Speak with confidence when you meet with your
teacher.
MITSURU: While I admire your determination... after we defeat
Nyx, our lives will continue on. So I would recommend
that you make thinking about your future more of a
priority.
FITNESS EXPERT: Today's Cantonese word is "Holeen." "Holeen" means
"Pitiful." Are we "Holeen" to be living in this kind of
world...? Well, that's all for this week... Back to the
news...

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: When I see that empty seat, it reminds me of Ryoji-san... I pointed at
him and called him dangerous... But, sadness and loneliness were also
trapped inside him... Ryoji-san...

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

Movie-loving Man: Sorry, man, but I don't believe in that cult stuff. "Nyx is
coming down"? I mean, what the hell, you know? There's only
one thing that comes from the skies... You know it! UFOs!
When it comes to invasions from above, accept no substitutes!

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

KEN: I've heard that one's upbringing determines how they develop socially.
Something as trivial as whether one's parents are strict or lenient...
will affect how that person learns to relate to others. It's a very
complex issue, indeed.
AIGIS: As an anti-Shadow weapon, I did what I was ordered to. My future was
decided for me. So, choosing my own future will be a new experience for
me. But... I will do my best.
JUNPEI: Dude, Career Counsiling... Why do we have to do this crap right before
a battle? Dammit, I've got too much on my mind... Ya think I can just
skip it...?
FUUKA: I've decided to go to college... It wasn't a difficult decision to make.
I mean, I couldn't think of anything I wanted to do besides study. So,
do you think I can really say that I "decided" my future?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: But, I should still have a broader outlook for my
future.
FUUKA: Well, it's fine for right now, but I can't just go to
school forever. I need to have a broader outlook for my
future.
FUUKA: Free will that is never bound by anything... or a will
that is forced to be silent... There is no end to this,
once it begins.
YUKARI: The timing for this couldn't be worse. Why do they have to talk to us
about what we want to do in the future now? What about you, Main-kun?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: Oh, then it should be a breeze for ya.
YUKARI: Well, I hope you're not thinking about it when you're
in a battle.
YUKARI: Yeah, I've pretty much made up my mind.
NEWSCASTER: Entrance exams are looming for the city's student
population. However, with the cultists around, please be
careful...

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: My friend's friend is all into that cult stuff. I heard he drew
some kind of symbol in his room, and his whole family is
complaining. I-I don't want that to happen... My family's okay,
right...?
FEMALE STUDENT: Every time I'm out, those people keep coming up to me and
saying, "Believe in Nyx-sama, and be saved!" Do I really look
that pitiful, just because I don't have a boyfriend?

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: Why bother doing anything at all, since the world is gonna end!?
...That's what some guy said to me.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

SALARYMAN: I did some research on the Internet, and read some books, and I've
got everything planned out now. I wish I could shake the hand of the
guy who invented life insurance. Converting people's death wishes
into money... I haven't completely decided to go through with it,
and I don't know if I'll tell anyone when I do. But just in case,
wish me luck.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===


=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

NARRATOR: On the next episode of Phoenix Ranger Featherman R!
FINAL EPISODE: Fly, Phoenix! A marriage between Hawk and
Swan! And as for Condor...
NEWSCASTER: ...And now, the news. Cult membership continues to grow,
while...

=== CLUBS HALL ===

Cell-phone Student: Oh man, this sucks... My friend is into that cult stuff.
So he keeps texting me these stupid-ass messages! Like this
one, where it just says "Nyx-sama" over and over, from
beginning to end. I've gotta figure out how to block his
messages...

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: When I was talking to Ms. Toriumi about my future, she laughed when I
told her I had big plans... But, who cares, right? We're goin' up
against Nyx. We'll be eaten alive if we don't think big.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

MATURE GIRL: ...I was ignoring my teacher, cause he never talks to me, so I
figured I'd be silent right back. Then he called on me, and I told
him so...
MAIN: 
MATURE GIRL: It was weird. He said, "I'm in the way of you guys
hanging out together, right?" He said the reason he
doesn't give much homework, and why he got mad at
me for ditching practice... Is because he'd rather
we have "Good memories of middle school," rather
than homework. I... I had no idea... I never
thought of it that way...
MATURE GIRL: No... He actually apologized to me. "Sorry for
being so quiet," he said. I didn't know he felt
that way... And I...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

AKIHIKO: The future is like train tracks... Even though our tracks are set to
fighting Nyx, we'll have to choose which tracks to take after that.
JUNPEI: See this cup ramen here? If I thought that this might be the last one,
I'd get all emotional about it. What about you?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: This is a great discovery. It's just cheap cup ramen.
Ahh, this is life... Soy sauce flavor.
JUNPEI: You're a jerk! We won't be able to defeat Nyx if you
keep acting like that.
KEN: If you think about it, deciding your future is good motivation. If there's
something you want to do in the future, then you have a reason to defeat
Nyx, right?
MAIN: 
KEN: I haven't really thought about my future because I'm so
young... But, I think this is a good opportunity for me to
do so right now...
KEN: I see... So, the future you're thinking about may not be
the future you want... That's very realistic.
YUKARI: I have no idea what's going on inside Junpei's head. How can
he make jokes at this time? I mean, the least he could do is make them
funny...
FUUKA: I understand how Junpei-kun feels. Anything can seem like a big deal if
you think it's the last time you'll be doing it... Isn't that a dreary
thought?
MAIN: 
FUUKA: When I think about it like that, I really want to save
this world.
FUUKA: Wow... You don't seem to have any attachments to things.
But, you should still want to save this world.
MITSURU: The day is almost here. This will be the last battle. There won't be
any second chances. You won't be able to obtain any additional items
or equipment, once it begins. So spend your time wisely until then.
AIGIS: My mission is about to end... the mission my creator gave me, to destroy
all Shadows... But another mission has just begun. My mission to live in
this world... I know I can do it, with help from all of you.
KOROMARU: 
AIGIS: I'm going to live, too. I want to be with everyone. That's what
he's saying. Don't worry, Koromaru-san. We'll be together
forever. Well, maybe not forever, but it's too early for our
lives to end now.
KOROMARU: Arf!

=== CLASS 2-F ===

AIGIS: Has everyone chosen a career? No matter what, you must have hope for the
future... That is what I think the meaning of life is.

NEWSCASTER: --farm found five eggs already with no yolk... According to
the village legend, eggs like these are signs of extreme
misfortune. The villagers are becoming terrified that a
catastrophe is about to happen.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

AIGIS: I don't quite understand what it means to "live" yet. So my Career
Counseling was really confusing. But, I know that if I'm with you,
everything will be okay.
NEWSCASTER: --woman scolded a group of teenagers for spraying graffiti.
She was subsequently stabbed by one of the youth, as the
rest of them fled the scene. Doctors say the woman was
lucky, and that her wounds will take around one week to
heal.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

FUUKA: Right now, Natsuki-chan is somewhere far from here, living courageously.
So, I will do the same.
KEN: Wow, black coffee is really bitter. I heard that when I grow up, I'll
acquire a taste for it. Do you think that's true?
MAIN: 
KEN: You're right... I don't know what I'm worrying about.
Well, lets do out best so we can look forward to drinking
coffee together.
KEN: You're right. No one knows about the future. Anyways,
let's do our best.
JUNPEI: This is gonna be the last battle, huh? Alright, then let's go to
Tartarus, Main!
AIGIS: It's almost time. How are your preperations going?
MAIN: 
AIGIS: Good. We need to be fully prepared if we want to win.
AIGIS: That's okay. If you double your effort, you'll be able
to fully prepare. Remember, we can't give up.
YUKARI: My father couldn't stop the experiment from happening... When I close
my eyes, I see his sad face, just like in that video... I gotta get rid
of the Dark Hour and return a smile to his face.
AKIHIKO: I don't know if you all realize this, but it's all gonna be over in a
few days. We've been through so much together... But, we can't think
about that now. We have to concentrate on defeating Nyx. So let's get
going to Tartarus.
NEWSCASTER: --note read "I failed the entrance exams. I have no reason
to live..." Police are ruling it a suicide over a failing
grade on his college entrance exams. There have been at
least eight reported cases of suicide as a result of the

AIGIS: We're only Juniors. It's too early to say goodbye to this school. We'll
continue to go here, right, Main-san?
MAIN: 
AIGIS: Let's both do our best. There must be a way to achieve
victory.
AIGIS: Don't be afraid. Let's fight together.
JUNPEI: This might sound weird coming from me, but school isn't so bad. I'm
looking forward to coming, actually, once this is all over.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

NEWSCASTER: We'll begin a new series of investigative reports today,
called "Hope for the Future." In light of the sharp income
divide, we'll poll citizens on what gives them hope for the
future. Our first report will be "Young Pessimists of the
Punctured Bubble." We'll follow youths who have thrown away
their hopes as a result of disillusionment in capitalism...

=== DORM LOUNGE, EVENING ===

NEWSCASTER: --park filling up with groups of people, all dressed in
black. The hordes of people seem to be a gathering of the
cult. Some members are holding placards reading "Nyx" or
"Quiet Revolution", making for an enigmatic scene...

=== DORM MEETING ROOM, EVENING ===

KOROMARU: 
YUKARI: My dad delayed the Fall until now... so he could pass me the baton.
And I'm going to run with it until the very end.
KEN: I must end the Dark Hour... for my mother, Shinjiro-san, and me. I will
fight with my all. It's not for revenge; it's so we can live.
FUUKA: If the world ends, our bonds of friendship will disappear... I don't
want that to happen. I want to strengthen our bonds, so I can't let the
world end today.
AIGIS: I want everyone to live... And I want to live, too... That's what I'm
going to fight for.
JUNPEI: Chidori gave me this life... and I'm not gonna let it end today! I'm
gonna beat the hell outta Nyx!
AKIHIKO: It all ends tonight... But don't worry, I know we'll win... Shinji
will be fighting with us tonight.
MITSURU: I wasn't able to save my father... But, his dreams live on inside of
me... I'll make sure they come true... Alright, let's get going.

=== FRONT GATE ===

GIRLFRIEND: I'm waiting for my boyfriend... He's going to walk me home today.
By the way, I'm not feeling anxious anymore.
CURIOUS STUDENT: I'll be a senior soon, which means I'll be studying for exams
every single day. But, that doesn't mean I'm going to stop
searching for mysterious buildings. I have a very inquiring
mind, you know. That's what makes me so interesting to talk
to.
STALKER GIRL: My senior year is just around the corner. Time flies, huh? I
spent the whole year talking and being stalked.  I have to
spend my time more wisely next year.
STALKED BOY: I'll be a senior soon. And then, all I'll be doing is
studying for my entrance exams. That's gonna suck... I mean, how
am I going to be able to study if she's following me around all
the time?

=== CLUBS HALL ===

Cell-phone Student: Oh, hey... What happened to those Apathy Syndrome people?
Just a little while ago, the town was think with them. Eh,
I'm busy text messaging, so tell me later.
FEMALE STUDENT: I wonder what kind of chemistry we'll be doing as seniors...
I can't wait!

=== 2F HALLWAY ===

FEMALE STUDENT: 3rd term is almost over. After spring vacation ends, we'll be
seniors... After that, we can't be lazy anymore. I think we
were talking about this last year, weren't we? The first-year's
3rd term...
FEMALE STUDENT: A year goes by so fast, doesn't it? We're almost seniors
already... Maybe I should start studying. I actually want to go
on with my education, so... Wasn't I saying the same things
last year, too? I guess I haven't grown since then...
MITSURU ADMIRER: You remember the weird stuff that happened about a month ago?
It was near midnight, and everyone was standing outside. I
was outside, too, but to tell you the truth, I don't remember
anything about it. I think it's because I'm too worried about
Mitsuru-senpai moving away to another country...
COMPLAINING GIRL: I've decided to go to a four-year college. I think it's true
that you need a good education in life. But that doesn't mean
I've given up! I'll get into the fashion industry, even if I
have to take a part-time job or something like that!

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: Well, no matter what people say, a lot happened this year... Nothing is
coming to mind, but... I know we did something huge... Weird... How
could I forget something so important...? Oh man, I'm getting a
headache. Dude, what the hell did we do this whole year?
FAT STUDENT: Changing semesters sucks, man. It's such a hassle to learn the new
routine.
MALE STUDENT: Graduation is coming up. But, it's a waste of time to pursue
anyone who's leaving. Next year will be tough, too, man! Those
hot chicks won't stay single for long! You better start planning
now!

=== PAULOWNIA MALL ===

Short-haired Housewife: Things have really calmed down over the last month.
It's like that cult thing never happened. All I'm
worried about now is my son's exam result. He says he's
confident, but we'll see.
HOUSEWIFE WITH BRAIDS: Yeah, those motionless people are all but gone,
and everything's back to normal. I'm glad that
all I have to worry about is my son's univeristy
exams next year.
OLD MAN: It's getting warm now... It's almost springtime. Puts me in the mood
to look for a new sweetheart or something.
GAMER STUDENT: I've completed the collection! My friend was surprised, too.

=== PORT ISLAND STATION ===

NERVOUS MAN: It's been one year, huh...? That was fast... Nothing's really
happened with us in that year...
PATIENT WOMAN: The year went by quickly. It's true that nothing's changed
during the year, but I'm not too worried about that. He's just
a straightforward kind of guy, and that's the way I like him!
LAZY STUDENT: Studying is so much work... But there's this college I really
want to get into, so... I guess I'll make the effort. Just a
little, anyway.
Movie-loving Man: That was some weird crap about a month ago, huh? I don't know
why, but all those people who were outside at midnight...
What were they all doing? It was pretty cool, though... Like
the climactic scene of a movie.
STATION ATTENDANT: Oh yeah, those Apathy Syndrome people disappeared. I wonder
why... Well, I don't really care, as long as the trains run
on time.

=== IWATODAI STATION ===

MATURE GIRL: My teacher is quiet, but he's so nice! He's the greatest! When
our graduation comes, I'm going to tell him how grateful I am.
TAXI DRIVER: I thought about following Nyx-sama, to see if I could get my
family back. But that wouldn't have helped. It was my fault,
sticking with this job and ignoring my family. I'm thinking about
going to see my wife, and trying to pathc things up with her...
SALARYMAN: I decided to get another job, but I've been keeping it secret from
my wife and my daughter. So even if I don't succeed, I've got a plan
B. I guess that's how the world works. People think nothing of
ruining someone else's life... I've just got to do my best. I'll
deal with what happens when it comes. What about you kids? Are you
satisfied with your lives?
FOOD GIRL: Did you eat the special Hagakure ramen? If you eat it with a
friend... You'll be friends forever! It might just be another rumor,
but... When I'm as old as you, I'm gonna go have some with my
friends.
Cat-obsessed Boy: Oh, that cat? He's not here. My mom said it was okay to take
him home, and I came the next day to pick him up, but he was
gone. That means he was free, right? So I bet things will be
better for him this way. That's okay... I won't look for him.
I know he's doing great, somewhere out there.
WOMAN: I'm not fond of animals, it's true, but... After seeing my son get that
serious about it, I felt like I should give it a chance anyway. I wish
I would've made the decision earlier...

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

NEWSCASTER: --news up next. Another look at the mysterious Apathy
Syndrome... As of last month, all patients have recovered,
and there have been no further recorded cases.

=== CLUB ESCAPADE ===

Fortune-Teller: Hmm... I see nothing in you... It seems you no longer need your
fortune told... All potentials are within you... You can go
anywhere, become anything... The universe is within you... And
you are within the universe... You and the universe are one and
the same... That is my belief...
MAN: Hey, how are you?
MAIN: 
MAN: I've finally started to get my groove back. I guess you
just can't rush these things.
MAN: If you're burning to groove too badly, you'll never do it.
Just mellow out and let things happen, y'know?
WOMAN: Some sad things have happened this season... In times like that, the way
to feel good again is to come here and dance. Yeah, that's the stuff.
Fortune-loving Girl: I'm cutting down on the fortune-telling. I've always let
my fortune determine what I do, and I thought fortune-
telling was so important, but... I'm trying not to be like
that anymore. From now on, I'll only hear my fortunes for
fun. I think that's the best way to treat that fortune-
telling stuff.
Girl's Friend: We've been like this ever since we were kids. She'd pull out
something weird and claim it was her lucky charm. I guess she
thought she could get more from those fortunes than they really
had to offer.

=== CLASS 2-F ===

JUNPEI: Hey, something's been bothering me... Who
used to sit in that empty seat?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: You don't remember either, huh? Dude, it's driving me
nuts.
JUNPEI: You too, huh? Who was it? It's driving me nuts.

=== DORM LOUNGE ===

NEWSCASTER: --almost finished cleaning up the graffiti, and the posters
are almost all torn down. The whereabouts of the cult at
this time is...
1. Retrieve 1 Beetle Shell.
ELIZABETH: I see you're brought 1 Beetle Shell, as I requested. Thank
you. Aren't you curious why I made such a request? Well,
I shall leave it to your imagination.
2. Retrieve the first old document.
ELIZABETH: Well done. You managed to retrieve the first old document in
time. Have you already read it? It's quite interesting...
If not, then I definitely recommend you take a look.
3. I'd like to sip a Muscle Drink.
ELIZABETH: Oh, my... I've never tried a Muscle Drink before... Is it
safe? Well, you have my thanks. I look forward to tasting
it.
4. Retrieve 3 Old Lanterns.
ELIZABETH: I see you've brought 3 Old Lanterns as I requested. Thank
you. As you know, this room is poorly lit. So, these will
help immensely with my reading.
5. Retrieve the second old document.
ELIZABETH: Ah, you've brought the second old document. Nicely done. You
may be wondering how these documents ended up in such an
unusual place... I believe that answer lies within the
tower.
6. Create Jack Frost with Dia.
ELIZABETH: I see that you have Jack Frost with you, and he has the
skill Dia... Well done. You have fufilled my request.
7. Retrieve 1 Lead Medal.
8. Create Valkyrie with Tarukaja.
ELIZABETH: I see that you have brought Valkyrie with the skill
Tarukaja... A fine specimen it is. Well, you have done as I
asked. The reward I'm going to give you this time has an
unusual effect. With it, you will be able to create Pale
Rider, a Persona with an affinity for the Death Arcana. If
you are strong enough to control this Persona, then please
give it a try.
9. Retrieve 5 Bronze Figurines.
ELIZABETH: I see you've brought 5 Bronze Figurines, as I requested.
Thank you. The Shadows you defeated to obtain them had an
affinity for the Fortune Arcana. It's unfortunate that
Persona must assume such a ridiculous form.
10. Retrieve 3 Snake Scales.
ELIZABETH: I see you've brought 3 Snake Scales, as I requested. Thank
you. The Lustful Snake is quite a strong enemy, but still
you were able to defeat it. As I suspected, great power
sleeps deep inside you. I look forward to seeing you unlock
your true potential...
11. Retrieve the third old document.
ELIZABETH: I see you've retrieved the thirld old document, and before
the deadline. Well done. Of course, it was written by a
human. But, who...? I'm sure you'll find the answer higher
in the tower...
12. Retrieve 1 Goggle-eyed Idol.
ELIZABETH: Ah, the Goggle-eyed Idol I requested... It looks quite
old... but I'm certain someone put a great deal of time and
energy into making it. If I'm not mistaken, there's a
Persona this item resembles...
13. Retrieve the shell of a man.
[Main goes to the science lab at school.]
Teacher's Voice: Well, what should we do with it? We can't burn it,
because that would release harmful chemicals. Maybe we
should just throw it away...
[Main enters.]
MS. OUNISHI: Oh, hi... Main, right? From the junior class? Do you have
any interest in this anatomical model? We were about to
throw it away... It's old and ugly, and the students think
it's creepy... I can't say that I disagree with them,
either. But, if you promise not to make any mischief with
it, you can have it. Please take good care of it. Well,
we're about ready to leave, so if you'll excuse us.
ELIZABETH: Oh, my... You actually brought it. Is that what everyone is
so afraid of? An Anatomical Model is merely a replica of the
human body. I don't understand what people find so repulsive
about it... If you ask me, it's rather charming. Oops...
The face came apart... Anyway, you have my gratitude. I'll
take good care of it.
14. Retrieve 1 Steel Medal.
15. Create Oberon .
ELIZABETH: Ah, I see you have Oberon with you, and he is at a
sufficient level. Did you know that a Persona is another
side of you? Just like you, it will grow and change.
However, the rate at which it grows depends more on your
Social Links than on your fighting. I suggest you make many
friends and deepen the bonds you've established.
16. Retrieve 1 Shadow Shard.
17. I'd like some funky school music.
[Main goes to the PA Room at school.]
Male Student's Voice: What the heck...!? ..."Gekkoukan Boggie"? Why
does the school have music like this...? ...Must
be a teacher's theme song or something.
...Crazy.
[Main enters the room.]
MALE STUDENT: Sorry, you have to have permission to be in-- Huh? This
music? I have no idea what it's for, but it says
"Gekkoukan Boogie" on it. Huh? You want it? ...Are you
serious!? Sure, you can have it. We don't have any use
for it, anyway... Here... Now, get out of here, before
you get me in trouble.
ELIZABETH: I see you have a cd with you... "Gekkoukan Boogie"?
...Do they play this often in your school? Oh... The lyrics
are included inside... "Everybody was Haiku writing... Those
kids were fast as lightning." ...... Um, I'll listen to this
later.
18. Retrieve 5 Relic Fragments
ELIZABETH: I see you've brought 5 Relic Fragments, as I requested.
Thank you. You know, it's a shame, really, that humans only
believe in what they can see. The statues those fragments
are from were made from people's feelings... Have you ever
thought about why your Persona looks as it does?
19. Retrieve 3 Greasy Gears.
ELIZABETH: I see you've brought 3 Greasy Gears, as I requested. Thank
you. You obtained these from a particularly strong
monster... In fact, you are much more formidable now than
when you first stepped into this room. I will have to think
of harder requests for you to fulfill.
20. Retrieve the 4th old document.
ELIZABETH: I see you've retrieved the fourth old document, and before
the deadline. Well done. We are one step closer to the
truth. You know, it seems like people write about both good
and bad experiences in their diaries, doesn't it? Have you
ever thought about that?
22. Create Vetala with Maragi.
ELIZABETH: I see that you have Vetala with you, and he has the skill
Maragi... Well done. You have fufilled my request. I have a
different reward for you this time. With it, you will be
able to create King Frost. If you're strong enough to
control this Persona, then give it a try.
23. Create Orthus with Dodge Slash.
ELIZABETH: Well done. I see that you have Orthus with you, and he has
the skill Dodge Slash... You have fufilled my request. For
your reward, I have selected a special piece of armor.
I think it will suit you well.
24. Retrieve 5 Tiara's Hair.
ELIZABETH: I see you have 5 Tiara's Hair with you--5 of them, just as
I requested. Thank you. You have claimed part of your
enemy's head, just as the samurai did long ago. Consider it
a sign of your victory.
25. Retrieve 4 Knight's Reins.
ELIZABETH: I see you have the Knight's Reins with you--4 of them, just
as I requested. Thank you. I'm sure you're wondering why I
requested this item. That's not what matters, though. What's
important is that you defeated the Champion Knight. I am
thrilled to see you getting stronger...
26. Retrieve the fifth old document.
ELIZABETH: I see you've retrieved the fifth old document and explored
the third block of Tartarus. Well done. You fufilled my
request before the deadline. However, we still do not know
how high up the tower extends... How many floors could it
possibly have...?
28. I'd like a drink that shares my name.
[Main goes to the bar behind Port Island Station.]
Young Man's Voice: Whoa... Not bad! I bet this'll be popular!
[Main enters the bar.]
BARTENDER: Sorry, we're not open yet... Hey, aren't you still in high
school? You're not s'posed to be here. ...Hm? You look like
you've been around the block a time or two... It must be
fate. Can you try this new cocktail I whipped up? Oh, don't
worry... There's no alcohol in it. ...It's my own little
concoction. I'm hoping to expand our clientele. Cheers.
sour. It has a refreshing flavor.
BARTENDER: So, whaddya think? Good, huh?
MAIN: 
BARTENDER: Right? I knew you'd like it.
BARTENDER: Haha... Maybe it's not for kids. Oh, well.
BARTENDER: Tell ya what... I'll give ya a bottle of it, on the house.
I'm gonna go home and catch some Z's. Come back when you're
legal, and I'll let you try the good stuff!
ELIZABETH: The drink you're carrying... It's for my request? "Queen
Elizabeth"... I suppose it does share the name
"Elizabeth"... But, if they were going to make this type of
drink, I wish they would have consulted me first. ..Oh,
well. It's non-alcoholic, isn't it? I'll try it later.
29. Create Oumitsunu .
ELIZABETH: Ah, I see you have Oumitsunu with you, and at a high enough
level. It's an impressive Persona... You have done well. I
have an interesting reward for you... With it, you will be
able to create Nata Taishi. If you're strong enough to
control this Persona, then please give it a try.
31. Find me a beautiful tile.
[Main goes to the Mah Jong Club behind Port Island Station.]
[If you have enough Courage, Main enters the Club.]
GAMBLER: ...I lost it all, man. Come on, kid, gimme some luck... No,
don't say a word! Ready... Rock-paper-scissors!
MAIN: 
GAMBLER: Wha...? I lost? ...I guess my luck has dried up.
Thanks, kid. You made me realize that gamling's a lost
cause. Starting today, I'm stopping cold turkey.
Here's a little something to say thanks... Anyway, you
shouldn't be hanging around a place like this... Now,
beat it!
GAMBLER: Hm? I won... I won...! I stil have some luck left!
I'm gonna place another bet... I'll win back
everything I lost! ...Beat it, kid... This place is
for adults only.
ELIZABETH: That Mahjong Tile you're carrying... It's just what I
requested. It has such a lovely design on it. It's a game
piece, is it not? I truly appreciate your efforts. Thank
you.
33. Retrieve 5 Empress's Mirrors.
ELIZABETH: The Empress's Mirror is an interesting item... I see that
you brought 5 of them with you, just as I requested. But,
I'm surprised that Shadows would be so vain...
34. Retrieve 3 Gold Handguards.
ELIZABETH: I see you brought 3 Gold Handguards, as I requested. Thank
you. They're perfect for use with a katana. Not many things
are both beautiful and functional, as these are.
35. Retrieve the sixth old document.
ELIZABETH: I see you've obtained the sixth old document from Tziah.
Very impressive. You've met the deadline, as well. Little by
little, you're uncovering hidden truths that most humans
will never be aware of... What does the world look like from
your eyes? I'm sure you see it differently than before.
That's the power of knowledge.
36. Create Black Frost.
ELIZABETH: That Persona I see within you... It must be the mischief
maker, Black Frost, come out from the Darkness to play.
Actually, this is the first time I've set eyes on him. I'm
sure there are others I've never seen before, sleeping deep
within the human mind...
38. I'd like to try sushi.
[Main inspects one of the shrines at Naganaki Shrine.]
to think of an acceptable way to obtain it.
Old Lady's Voice: Hey! You there!
[The old lady comes over.]
OLD LADY: Why do you have such a sullen look on your face? Did
something happen? A boy your age should be carefree... What
you need is a good meal and some rest, and you'll feel
better! Here, have this Inari Sushi...
OLD LADY: You have to be optimistic! Your generation is Japan's
future! Well, good luck. Cheer up!
ELIZABETH: Is that Inari Sushi you have with you? I've heard it's
delicious. Its scent really whets my appetite. I look
forward to tasting it later.
39. Retrieve 3 Gold Rings.
ELIZABETH: I see you brought 3 Gold Rings, as I asked. Thank you. The
Wondrous Magus is a tough foe, is it not? And yet, you still
have managed to fulfill my request. As my master says, it
seems you have unlimited potential.
40. Retrieve 2 Red Armor Plates.
ELIZABETH: I see you brought 2 Red Armor Plates, as I requested. Thank
you. To defeat Shadows carrying this type of item must have
been difficult. By the way... Occasionally, you may
encounter Shadows that resemble things in your world. Be
aware that they may share other similarities beyond their
appearance.
41. Retrieve the seventh old document.
ELIZABETH: It seems you've retrieved the seventh old document from the
highest region of Tziah. That means you've finished
exploring the 4th block of Tartarus. However, I feel your
greatest challenge is yet to come... My master and I have
watched your growth with great delight... I hope you will
be alright.
42. Create Girimehkala.
ELIZABETH: I see that Girimehkala now resides within you... Well done.
You have fulfilled my request. I have prepared a special
reward for you once again... With it, you will be able to
create Nebiros. If you are strong enough to control this
Persona, then please give it a try.
43. Create Daisoujou.
ELIZABETH: I see that Daisoujou now resides within you... It is a hard
Persona to come by, even through fusion... Yet, you added it
to your repertoire so easily... It seems you are quickly
mastering the art of fusion.
44. Retrieve 6 Pink Feathers.
ELIZABETH: I see you brought 6 Pink Feathers, as I requested. Thank
you. They'd make adorable wings, don't you think? I'll take
good care of them.
45. Retrieve 3 Moon Tablets.
ELIZABETH: I see you brought 3 Moon Tablets, as I requested. Thank you.
You will gradually encounter stronger Shadows as you ascend
Tartarus. The floors that you'll be exploring next are
populated with very strong monsters. Please keep this in
mind.
46. Retrieve the last old document.
ELIZABETH: Ah, it seems you've retrieved the old document from
Harabah. That will be the last one I ask you to find. I
wanted you to learn the truth from the eight documents
you've collected... However, you are already moving towards
another truth. Although memories may remind you of the past,
always walk toward the future... I must admit... I'm a bit
envious, since I have neither.
48. Create Alice with Megido.
ELIZABETH: I see that you have Alice with you, and she has the skill
Megido... I knew you could do it. Congratulations, you've
fulfilled my request. You're one step closer to mastering
the art of fusion. I believe I have something you may
like... With it, you'll be able to create Lilith. She's an
incredibly strong Persona. I'm sure she'll be a big help to
you.
49. Retrieve 3 Sands of Time.
ELIZABETH: The Sand of Time is a mysterious item... I see that you
brought 3 of them with you, just as I requested. The sand
represents time itself... But since time does not exist in
this room, it's just ordinary sand here.
50. Retrieve 3 Rainbow Hairs.
ELIZABETH: Ah, so that's what Rainbow Hair looks like... It has such
beautiful colors. I bet you're wondering what I plan to use
it for... Well, that's a secret.
51. Create Lilith with Mabufudyne.
ELIZABETH: I see that you have Lilith with you, and she has the skill
Mabufudyne... She is much stronger than she appears... I'm
impressed you can control her. Well done. You've fulfilled
my request.
52. Create Loki .
ELIZABETH: Ah, I see you have Loki with you, and he is at a sufficient
level. Well done. You've fulfilled my request. I have asked
you to create twelve different Personas through fusion. You
have done so impressively, and in the process, expanded your
arsenal of Personas. And now, I'm giving you the perfect
reward to assist you. With it, you'll be able to create
Masakado via fusion. Masakado is unbelievably strong, and
you will need to be equally powerful to control him. But,
I'm sure you are up to the challenge.
53. Retrieve 1 Bloody Button.
ELIZABETH: I see you've obtained a Bloody Button... So, you've defeated
The Reaper, have you? Most impressive. You are approaching
the level of strength I hoped you'd achieve... I have waited
so very long, in this room where time has no meaning... You
may be the one to help me answer the question that has
confounded me...
55. Defeat the ultimate opponent.
[Main has just decided to kill Ryoji. If Ryoji was in his Thanatos form, he
changes back to normal first.]
RYOJI: So... you understand. I think that looking to the future is a great way
to live. But, that doesn't mean that other ways of living are wrong. No
one knows which road leads to happiness. I'm glad I met you. This must
be what it means to "feel happy". Thanks for everything...
[Main pulls out his Evoker and puts it to his head. As the scene fades out, the
sound of it firing is heard.]
chalk on a sidewalk... When you awoke, peaceful days had returned again. The
school year rolled on, as if nothing had ever happened. And so, the season
changed... ...... Two months later...
[The day is now March 3rd. Main arrives at school. Junpei runs up behind him.]
JUNPEI: Yo! Damn, it's cold. But of course, you never miss a day of school.
Man, can ya believe this year's already over? We're practically seniors
now. Just one more year... Ya think anything interesting will happen?
MAIN: 
JUNPEI: I hope you're right. But, seeing the current seniors makes me
wonder...
JUNPEI: Well, seeing the current seniors makes me wonder...
JUNPEI: Seems like all they frickin' do is study. Talk about boring. Is that
gonna be us next year? ...Why do I feel like I'm forgetting something?
[Junpei shakes his head and they walk forward. They spot Aigis next to a tree.]
JUNPEI: Hey, is that girl looking at us? Dude, she's pretty cute! How come I
never noticed her before?
[Yukari walks up to them from behind.]
YUKARI: What are you talking about? She lives in the same dorm as us.
JUNPEI: Seriously!? Uh... What's her name, then?
YUKARI: I dunno.
JUNPEI: So then, why're you giving me a hard time? Anyway, it's always crazy in
the dorms this time of year, with so many people coming and going. Oh
yeah, did ya hear? Akihiko-senpai's movin' out. Ya know, the Captain of
the boxing team?
YUKARI: I know who he is, but I haven't really talked to him. Of course, all
the graduates are leaving, even Kirijo-senpai.
JUNPEI: Ms. Student Council President... She's in our dorm too, huh?
[They turn to look back at Aigis. Yukari waves.]
YUKARI: Hey, there! Are you looking at us? Is something wrong?
STRANGE GIRL: Um... It's nothing.
[Aigis runs away.]
JUNPEI: She looks kinda depressed, doesn't she? ...Wait, do ya think she might
be interested in one of us!?
YUKARI: Haha, I doubt it.
JUNPEI: ...Ouch. That hurts.
[They walk inside and the scene fades out.]
[Time skips ahead two days to March 5th.]
better get going...
[Later, Main is at the Senior Graduation ceremony.]
TEACHER: Next, a word from the valedictorian... From Class D, Mitsuru Kirijo.
MITSURU: Thank you.
[Mitsuru walks onstage over to the podium.]
MITSURU: This last year, I accepted an important responsibility as
Student Council President. When I first addressed you from this
podium, I spoke to you all about seizing opportunity while you
had the chance... Well, it must have been fate that intervened
and gave me an important reminder of this... As many of you may
know, my father unexpectedly passed away due to illness... To
tell you the truth, after losing my father, I also lost much of
my self-confidence. You see, I had overestimated my ability to
handle everything alone. Few people can be that strong... There
are times when we cannot stand without the support of others...
After my father's death, I received kind words from many
people. You all taught me the value of allowing yourself to be
cared for and protected. I would like to continue going forward
with the support of those around me. For us graduates, it was
truly an honor to share the last three years with all of you.
Thank you so much... for those wonderful years...
[She steps back from the podium. The focus changes to Main, Junpei, and
Yukari.]
JUNPEI: ...She seems kinda bummed, doesn't she? I guess even Presidents cry
too...
MAIN: 
[Junpei looks around.]
JUNPEI: Hey, where's that girl?
YUKARI: What are you talking about?
JUNPEI: You know, the girl we saw the other day. I assumed she'd be here...
YUKARI: Oh, her. Well, there's a lot of people who aren't here. Actually, I'm
surprised YOU didn't skip.
JUNPEI: Heh, I thought about it. Anyway, next year it'll be our turn... What
have you got planned, Yuka-tan? College?
YUKARI: Mmmm... I haven't really decided yet.  What about you?
MAIN: 
YUKARI: That's what I thought.
YUKARI: Oh, really? Well, I never would've guessed it.
YUKARI: You know how the President was crying? I can sorta relate, since my dad
passed away too. But, that stuff she said about seizing opportunities?
Gimme a break. We're only in high school. I mean, yeah it's important,
but can't it wait a few years? ...But anyway, there's really no hurry
to decide what we wanna do with our lives, right? I mean, high school's
hard enough as it is.
JUNPEI: Yeah, I can agree with that.
YUKARI: Here's what I think... Sometimes you're better off not knowing. As they
say, "Ignorance is bliss." Besides, you can't always be thinking about
the future. In the end, it doesn't matter as long as you're happy.
You've got to live in the moment--carpe diem, right?
JUNPEI: ...Yeah, I guess so. Whew, that was some speech.
YUKARI: To be honest, I'm not that strong of a person... That's why I get so
worked up so easily. It's hard to explain. It's just the way I am.
JUNPEI: Hey, I know where you're coming from. Thinking about stuff like that
just gives me a headache. So, I try to avoid it as much as possible.
YUKARI: Now, that's the Junpei we all know and love.
JUNPEI: Everyone's so uptight these days. They just need to chill out... You
know, take it easy for a change.
YUKARI: What're you gonna do if that plan backfires?
JUNPEI: Well, that'll be that. But for now, let the good times roll... Karaoke,
anyone? Let's celebrate our future!
YUKARI: A graduation party, huh? I'll go if he goes.
JUNPEI: Well in that case, I won't take no for an answer. I'll buy ya a drink,
alright?
MAIN: 
[The credits roll as a montage of anime scenes flash by. Afterwards, Akihiko
and Mitsuru are shown walking outside, follewed by a scene showing Main,
Yukari, and Junpei singing karaoke. "Fin" is displayed in the corner, and then
the game prompts a New Game cycle save before returning to the title screen.]
[Main goes to the top of Monad and finds Elizabeth.]
ELIZABETH: I have been waiting for you. The adversary I asked you to defeat is
now standing before you. Yes... I am referring to myself. I have
long sought an understanding of who I am... Just as you and my
master have done. Those who set foot in the Velvet Room are all
destined to embark on this search for identity. I have come to know
power in many forms... If I face one whose power exceeds my own,
then I may discover an answer to my question... The truth of my
existance. You may be able to give me that answer... Will you do me
the honor of fighting me?
MAIN: 
ELIZABETH: You have my thanks. Now, shall we begin?
ELIZABETH: Then, I will wait here until you are ready.
[Main begins battle with Elizabeth.]
FUUKA: Who is that...? Ummm... Is it just me, or does it seem
like she wants to fight...? What!? Her power is unbelieveable! ...Who
IS she!?
ELIZABETH: I make my living as an elevator attendant, but... I know several
effective ways of inflicting pain. Don't worry, I'm not as fragile
as I look. Try to kill me... if you can.
[Elizabeth takes some damage.]
ELIZABETH: Magnificent! Your power is every bit as impressive as I'd hoped...
But, the curtain has just rise... Show me your best performance!
[Elizabeth is defeated.]
ELIZABETH: I... I believed that I would find my answer when I challenged one
who was stronger than me... But, I was wrong... I have received no
such revelation, not even in defeat. Wait... I am mistaken... The
ANSWER IS THIS: Only I can decide who I am. Now, I believe
congratulations are in order... You have overcome the most difficult
obstacle I've placed in your path. You shall receive your reward
the same as always... But... please accept this as well. It is no
reward; it is a sign of my gratitude.
ELIZABETH: Well then, good day...
ELIZABETH: Thank you for the wonderful time. Now, please make your way
to the entrance. I have some thinking to do. I shall see you
again in the Velvet Room.
Second Trailer quotes
PHAROS: Soon, the end will come.
MITSURU: Do you remember the night you came here? You had to have noticed the
signs.
AKIHIKO: What!?
MITSURU: Didn't it feel like you were in a different time? That's the Dark Hour.
We'd like you to lend us your strength.
AIGIS: A machine is created for a purpose. Mine is to defeat you.
TAKAYA: Fate permitted me to live...
KEN: Shut up!
TAKAYA: You might say I was... chosen.
JUNPEI: I've made up my mind. I won't let you do this to her anymore!
TAKAYA: Only a select few wield the power of a Persona, and the Dark Hour is a
frontier that is ours alone to explore.
YUKARI: There's no telling what will happen if we don't do something about the
Shadows.
JIN: That makes you all hypocrites!
JUNPEI: I said shut up.
YUKARI: ...Don't look up.
AKIHIKO: We call them "Shadows".
SHINJIRO: Yeah, so what?
YUKARI: Haha! What was that?
FUUKA: I want to protect you....
MITSURU: To truly live, you will need to make changes sometimes.
IGOR: The time has come for you to wield your power. Going forward, there is
one thing you mustn't forget.
AIGIS: No, don't go!
IGOR: You must accept your destiny.
MITSURU: We've come this far!
ELIZABETH: Shall we begin?
RYOJI: Midnight's just around the corner.
